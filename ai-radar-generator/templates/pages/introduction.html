    An introduction to the AI Radar from JUXT CTO, Henry Garner
  </h2>

  <p>
    Keeping pace with AI development feels increasingly difficult. New tools
    appear weekly, claims about capabilities shift monthly, and what seemed
    essential last quarter might be yesterday’s news.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the past year, our teams have been applying AI across client projects,
    from coding assistants to agent frameworks, from prompt engineering to model
    selection. We’ve seen what works in practice, what doesn’t live up to the
    marketing, and where the real value lies for organisations trying to make
    sensible technology choices.
  </p>
  <p>
    We’ve distilled these insights into our first AI Radar: an opinionated guide
    to the tools, techniques, and platforms we think are worth your attention
    right now. It’s structured around four rings (adopt, trial, assess, and
    hold) making it easier to understand what’s ready for production use versus
    what needs more time to mature.
  </p>
  <p>
    This isn’t a snapshot: we’ll be updating it regularly as the landscape
    evolves and our understanding deepens. If you’re navigating AI adoption in
    your organisation, we hope it provides a useful reference point.

  <h2>Radar overview</h2>
  <p>
    Our radar is organized into four main categories, each containing
    technologies evaluated across four adoption levels:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Adopt</strong>: Technologies we recommend using now</li>
    <li><strong>Trial</strong>: Worth exploring for new projects</li>
    <li><strong>Assess</strong>: Keep under observation</li>
    <li><strong>Hold</strong>: Not recommended for new projects</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Categories</h2>
  <p class="introduction-category">Techniques</p>
  <p>
    AI methodologies, approaches, and practices that shape how we build
    intelligent systems.
  </p>

  <p class="introduction-category">Languages &amp; frameworks</p>
  <p>
    Programming languages, libraries, and frameworks that power AI development.
  </p>

  <p class="introduction-category">Tools</p>
  <p>Software tools and utilities that enhance AI development workflows.</p>

  <p class="introduction-category">Platforms</p>
  <p>Infrastructure and platform services that support AI applications.</p>
