    An introduction to the AI Radar from JUXT CTO, Henry Garner
  </h2>

  <p>
    Well, 2025 finally WAS the year of agents. After several years of bold
    predictions, agentic AI systems have genuinely begun delivering value in
    production environments. The gap between demo and deployment has narrowed
    considerably, though perhaps not as dramatically as the conference keynotes
    suggested. This quarter's radar reflects that maturation.
  </p>
  <p>
    We've added Temporal to our Adopt ring, recognising that durable workflow
    orchestration has become essential infrastructure for agents that need to
    survive failures, handle human approvals, and run reliably over days rather
    than seconds. We're also seeing organisations move beyond prototypes to ask
    harder questions: how do we understand our processes before automating them?
    How do we monitor agents in production? The new entries for process mining
    and LLM observability reflect this shift from experimentation to operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time there's the growing recognition that LLMs alone aren't
    sufficient for every problem. Neurosymbolic AI, combining neural networks
    with symbolic reasoning, has emerged as a practical architecture for systems
    requiring explainable decisions or guaranteed rule compliance. We've
    expanded our coverage of Prolog, added entries for phased ontology
    development and LinkML, and introduced neurosymbolic AI as a technique worth
    assessing. For regulated industries especially, the ability to couple an
    LLM's flexibility with auditable logical inference addresses limitations
    that prompt engineering alone cannot solve.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, AI is increasingly escaping the screen. Foundation models
    purpose-built for robotics and physical systems are maturing rapidly, and
    digital twin platforms like NVIDIA Omniverse are enabling organisations to
    train and test AI in simulation before deployment. We've added coverage of
    both areas for teams working at the intersection of AI and the physical
    world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond these themes, one thing has become undeniable: AI is now a
    fundamental part of how we build software. From code generation and review
    to testing, documentation, and deployment, AI tools are touching every
    aspect of the software development lifecycle. What began as autocomplete
    suggestions has evolved into genuine collaboration between developers and AI
    systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    As always, this radar represents our current thinking based on what we're
    seeing across client engagements. The landscape continues to shift quickly,
    and we expect our recommendations to evolve with it.

  <h2 class="introduction-title">Radar overview</h2>
  <p>
    Our radar visualises the AI landscape across two dimensions: quadrants
    divide the space by category, while radiants indicate our confidence in
    each technology.
  </p>

  <h3>Quadrants</h3>
  <p>
    The radar is divided into four quadrants, each representing a category of
    AI technology:
  </p>
  <p class="introduction-category">Techniques</p>
  <p>
    Methodologies, architectural patterns, and practices for building AI
    systems: approaches like RAG, prompt engineering, agent design patterns, and
    evaluation methodologies. The "how" of AI development.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction-category">Languages &amp; frameworks</p>
  <p>
    Programming languages, libraries, and frameworks that form the building
    blocks of AI applications. From orchestration frameworks to specialised
    languages for symbolic reasoning, these are the tools you write code with.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction-category">Tools</p>
  <p>
    Software that enhances AI development workflows without being embedded in
    your application code: IDE extensions, CLI utilities, testing frameworks,
    and observability solutions.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction-category">Platforms</p>
  <p>
    Infrastructure and managed services that host and run AI workloads: cloud AI
    services, vector databases, model serving platforms, and MLOps
    infrastructure.
  </p>

  <h3>Radiants</h3>
  <p>
    Each item is placed on one of four concentric rings representing our
    recommended adoption stance:
  </p>
  <p class="introduction-category">Adopt</p>
  <p>
    Technologies we have high confidence in. Proven in production with strong
    community support; we'd recommend them for appropriate use cases without
    hesitation.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction-category">Trial</p>
  <p>
    Worth pursuing. These show strong promise and are mature enough to invest
    time in learning and piloting. Consider them for new projects where you can
    absorb some risk.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction-category">Assess</p>
  <p>
    Worth exploring to understand how they might affect your organisation.
    Research is warranted, but they're not yet ready for serious investment.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction-category">Hold</p>
  <p>
    Proceed with caution. Technologies that are immature, overhyped, or being
    superseded. Not recommended for new work, though existing usage may be fine.
  </p>
