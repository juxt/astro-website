    Introduction
  </h2>

  <p>
    2025 delivered on the promise of agentic AI. After years of bold predictions,
    we're now seeing genuine production value, and the impact is profound.
  </p>
  <p>
    For software engineering, this represents the most significant transition since
    compilers changed what it meant to write code, but the implications reach
    even further. Agentic AI provides a co-intelligence that puts capabilities once
    requiring technical specialists within everyone's reach, much as spreadsheets did a generation
    ago: transformative business value and new categories of risk to manage.
    We're still early in understanding the full scope of this change, and this
    quarter's radar captures both the areas that are maturing and the emerging
    frontiers that point to what comes next.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the maturity side, we've added Temporal to our Adopt ring, recognising
    that durable workflow orchestration has become essential infrastructure for
    agents that need to survive failures and run reliably over days rather
    than seconds. Organisations are moving beyond
    prototypes to ask harder questions: how do we understand our processes
    before automating them? How do we monitor agents in production? The new
    entries for process mining and LLM observability reflect this shift from
    experimentation to operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the frontier side, we're seeing growing interest in approaches that
    extend beyond what LLMs alone can achieve. Ontologies provide grounded
    semantics, giving AI systems authoritative definitions and relationships
    rather than statistical associations. Neurosymbolic AI couples neural
    networks with symbolic reasoning, enabling explainable decisions and
    guaranteed rule compliance. World models build internal representations
    that simulate how environments behave, enabling systems to predict
    consequences rather than merely paraphrase scenarios from training data.
    Together, these approaches point toward AI architectures that combine LLM
    flexibility with the formal semantics that regulated industries require.
  </p>
  <p>
    AI is also escaping the screen. Foundation models purpose-built for robotics
    and physical systems are maturing rapidly, and digital twin platforms such as
    NVIDIA Omniverse are enabling organisations to train and test AI in
    simulation before deployment. We've added coverage of both areas for teams
    working at the intersection of AI and the physical world.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we enter 2026, this radar captures where the landscape stands today.
    We're still in the early stages of this transformation, one we're following
    with professional and personal interest.

  <h2 class="introduction-title">Radar overview</h2>
  <p>
    Our radar visualises the AI landscape across two dimensions: quadrants
    divide the space by category, while radiants indicate our confidence in
    each technology.
  </p>

  <h3>Quadrants</h3>
  <p>
    The radar is divided into four quadrants, each representing a category of
    AI technology:
  </p>
  <p class="introduction-category">Languages &amp; frameworks</p>
  <p>
    The frameworks, libraries, and protocols that underpin AI development.
    These are the software foundations your applications are built with.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction-category">Techniques</p>
  <p>
    Methodologies and practices for building AI systems: approaches such as RAG,
    prompt engineering, agent design patterns and evaluation methodologies. The
    "how" of AI development.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction-category">Tools</p>
  <p>
    Software that enhances AI development workflows without being embedded in
    your application code: IDE extensions, CLI utilities, testing frameworks
    and observability solutions.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction-category">Platforms</p>
  <p>
    Infrastructure and managed services that host and run AI workloads: cloud AI
    services, vector databases, model serving platforms and MLOps
    infrastructure.
  </p>

  <h3>Radiants</h3>
  <p>
    Each item is placed on one of four concentric rings representing our
    recommended adoption stance:
  </p>
  <p class="introduction-category">Adopt</p>
  <p>
    Technologies we have high confidence in. Proven in production with strong
    community support; we'd recommend them for appropriate use cases without
    hesitation.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction-category">Trial</p>
  <p>
    Worth pursuing. These show strong promise and are mature enough to invest
    time in learning and piloting. Consider them for new projects where you can
    absorb some risk.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction-category">Assess</p>
  <p>
    Worth exploring to understand how they might affect your organisation.
    Research is warranted, but they're not yet ready for serious investment.
  </p>
  <p class="introduction-category">Hold</p>
  <p>
    Proceed with caution. Technologies that are immature, overhyped, or being
    superseded. Not recommended for new work, though existing usage may be fine.
  </p>
