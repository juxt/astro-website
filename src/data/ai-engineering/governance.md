As AI-assisted development scales across your organisation, governance ensures it remains effective, safe, and aligned with business objectives:

- **Policy and standards** - establishing clear guidelines for when and how AI tools are used, ensuring consistency across teams and projects
- **Quality assurance** - continuous monitoring of AI-generated output against your engineering standards, catching degradation before it reaches production
- **Risk management** - identifying and mitigating risks specific to AI-assisted development, from intellectual property concerns to supply chain dependencies

Governance is not about slowing teams down. It is about giving leadership confidence that AI adoption is controlled, measurable, and delivering genuine value.
