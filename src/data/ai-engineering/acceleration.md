With the foundation in place, we apply AI-assisted development to deliver against your roadmap - faster.

We work with you to identify target milestones and use the measurement framework to demonstrate acceleration: quantifiable improvements in delivery speed, with quality held constant or improved.

During this phase, we gather sufficient data to identify where AI-assisted development delivers genuine productivity gains and where it introduces risk. This evidence base informs decisions about where and how to scale AI adoption further.

The deliverable is measurable acceleration against roadmap targets, validated by real data.
