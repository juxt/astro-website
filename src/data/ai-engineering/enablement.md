We embed with your engineering team to introduce AI-assisted development into existing workflows. This is not a training exercise - we write code alongside your engineers and establish practices through working software.

At the same time, we stand up a measurement framework that gives leadership an honest picture of impact:

- **DORA metrics** as baseline indicators of delivery performance
- **Code health metrics**, including defect density and test quality measured through mutation testing
- **AI contribution analysis**, tracking AI-assisted versus manual contributions with quality indicators for each

The deliverable is a working measurement framework and an engineering team using AI-assisted development with confidence.
