Once confidence in AI-assisted development is established, we apply it to larger transformation objectives:

- **Vendor replacement** - moving vendor-supplied systems in-house, where AI-assisted development can dramatically reduce the cost and timeline of building replacements
- **Legacy modernisation** - porting legacy applications to a modern, cleaner platform, with AI accelerating the translation of business logic while engineers focus on architectural improvement

Each phase delivers standalone value. You can stop after any phase if the results do not justify continuing.
