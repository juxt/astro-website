## Job Description

We’re looking for Java developers at all levels, ranging from Junior (2+ years’ experience) to Principal engineers and Architects, to join us as we kick off new Java projects with tier-1 investment banks.

You’ll work on mission-critical systems bringing the best modern software engineering to client projects across banking and finance. If you’re new to banking, it’s also a great way to break into the domain and build deep industry knowledge.

This role will include hands-on work to bring improvements to new and existing systems, bringing fast builds and feedback, TDD, CI/CD, clean code, automation, and good taste software engineering. Experience with microservice and cloud architecture is beneficial, particularly with AWS.

Our work ranges from greenfield builds on core trading and payments platforms for key areas of the bank, to bringing radical improvements to existing systems, re-writing legacy applications, or rescuing struggling projects. What’s consistent across all of our work is our commitment to good coding hygiene - best practices, clean design, and building elegant, robust software.

This is an excellent environment for junior candidates to learn, and also for seasoned senior engineers to apply everything they know about writing and delivering good software projects. You'll be working day to day with other talented engineers from JUXT and our clients.

We’re looking for developers who are passionate, enthusiastic, technically curious, and with excellent communication skills. Maybe you mentor others, run or attend meetups, write blogs or record podcasts, contribute to open source, or just like to stay up-to-date with the latest in Java. Whatever your background, we value people who care about system design, software craftsmanship, and clear communication.

## Core skills

* Strong Java skills
* Solid experience with Spring Boot
* Good understanding of TDD, XP and Agile principles
* Exposure to cloud architecture and CI/CD pipelines
* Experience building large-scale systems
* Engineers with great technical taste who can improve existing projects

## Nice to have

* Experience working on high-throughput or low-latency systems
* Experience with AWS
* Experience in investment banking, financial services, or fintech
* Consultancy or client-facing experience
* Knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes

## WFH?
These roles are hybrid - a mix of working from home and on-site collaboration with clients (Central London or Canary Wharf).

## Contract type
Both permanent and contract arrangements considered.

## Eligibility
We can only consider candidates who have the right to work in the UK and do not require visa sponsorship. Applicants must be UK-based and within a commutable distance to London.

## Interested?

Email careers@juxt.pro with your CV and a brief introduction. Even if you’re not sure you tick every box, we’d still love to hear from you - we’re always keen to meet passionate, technically curious developers and can keep you in mind for future projects if this one isn’t the right fit.
