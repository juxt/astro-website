## Job Description

We’re looking for experienced Golang engineers to join us on a cutting-edge platform engineering and AI programme with a global financial leader.

You’ll be part of a high-calibre engineering team building secure, scalable AI platforms. You’ll work on Platform Engineering and Internal Developer Platform initiatives that help engineering teams move faster, and on agentic AI tooling that's transforming how we work.

This role sits at the intersection of core engineering and emerging AI technology. You’ll be helping to shape best practices for how developers use GenAI tools safely and effectively, building secure frameworks and core platform services for use of AI, and deploying LLMs in a private enterprise environment.

If you enjoy solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and contributing to high-impact technical strategy, you’ll feel right at home.

## Core skills

* Strong commercial experience with Go — this is essential
* Deep knowledge of Kubernetes
* Solid understanding of cloud-native architecture, scaling, SRE and DevOps practices
* Breadth across core engineering disciplines (infrastructure, architecture frameworks, CI/CD, security, scaling)
* Curiosity and enthusiasm for agentic and generative AI technologies

## Nice to have, but not essential

* Experience in Platform Engineering teams, running technical platforms at scale
* Knowledge of other languages such as Kotlin, Java, or Python
* Background in financial services or large-scale engineering environments
* Experience contributing to open-source or internal frameworks

## What we offer

* Work on a high-profile, long-term programme with a global financial leader. You'll have a significant impact, and a chance to build platform features that you can be proud of.
* Work in a talented team, learning from exceptional colleagues with a real focus on getting things done.
* Opportunities for learning and growth, including exposure to the latest AI technologies and practices.
* Great benefits, including full medical, 10% matched pension and regular premium events.

## WFH?
These roles are hybrid - typically one office day **per month**, with most work done remotely. You’ll need to be UK-based and within a commutable distance to London for occasional on-site collaboration.

## Contract type
Permanent only.

## Eligibility
We can only consider candidates who have the right to work in the UK and do not require visa sponsorship.

## Interested?

Email careers@juxt.pro with your CV and a brief introduction. Even if you’re not sure you tick every box, we’d still love to hear from you - we’re always keen to meet passionate, technically curious developers and can keep you in mind for future projects if this one isn’t the right fit.
