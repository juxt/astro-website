## Job Description

We’re looking for experienced Go engineers at Mid and Senior levels to join us on a long-term, cloud-native transformation programme with one of our global financial services partners.

You’ll be part of a high-calibre engineering team building secure, scalable platforms that underpin critical trading and data systems. You’ll work on Platform Engineering and Internal Developer Platform initiatives that help engineering teams move faster.

This role sits at the intersection of core engineering and emerging AI technology. You’ll be helping to shape best practices for how developers use GenAI tools safely and effectively, building secure frameworks and core platform services for use of AI, and deploying LLMs in a private enterprise environment.

If you enjoy solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and contributing to high-impact technical strategy, you’ll feel right at home.

## Core skills

* Strong commercial experience with Go (Golang) — this is essential
* Deep knowledge of Kubernetes (expect in-depth technical discussion at interview)
* Solid understanding of cloud-native architecture, scaling, and DevOps practices
* Breadth across core engineering disciplines (infrastructure, frameworks, CI/CD, security, scaling)
* Curiosity and enthusiasm for AI and GenAI technologies (no prior commercial experience needed)

## Nice to have

* Knowledge of other languages such as Kotlin, Java, or Python
* Background in financial services or large-scale engineering environments
* Experience contributing to open-source or internal frameworks

## WFH?
These roles are hybrid - typically 1–3 office days per quarter, with most work done remotely. You’ll need to be UK-based and within a commutable distance to London for occasional on-site collaboration.

## Contract type
Permanent only.

## Eligibility
We can only consider candidates who have the right to work in the UK and do not require visa sponsorship. Applicants must be UK-based and within a commutable distance to London.

## Interested?

Email careers@juxt.pro with your CV and a brief introduction. Even if you’re not sure you tick every box, we’d still love to hear from you - we’re always keen to meet passionate, technically curious developers and can keep you in mind for future projects if this one isn’t the right fit.
