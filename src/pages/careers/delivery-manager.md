## Job Description

JUXT is seeking a Delivery Manager to join our growing engineering function, working across banking, finance, and variety of other sectors. We are a software consultancy specialising in high quality software delivery, data-centric architectures, and building ambitious new bespoke software systems. We're looking for Delivery Managers that can help us maintain highly-effective engineering teams and build excellent client relationships.

JUXT has a strong engineering-first culture and as a manager supporting our projects you must have at least some experience working as a software engineer. We are looking to grow our existing delivery management function to ensure our projects run smoothly and that new clients get what they need from JUXT.

About this role:

- You'll be responsible for project delivery from inception, either to completion (for short missions), or through consistent ongoing development (for longer missions).
- You'll line manage a number of engineers, building strong working relationships with your team.
- You'll track key project details and report financial information for your projects.
- You'll help us maintain a culture of engineering excellence and ambition at JUXT.

The ideal candidate,

- is effective at managing a variety of tasks and demands,
- has strong technical knowledge and experience working as an engineer,
- has used many Agile engineering and planning techniques,
- can help organise engineering teams towards high productivity,
- can identify delivery risks early and work to eliminate them, and is skilled at unblocking teams,
- can build strong client relationships based on good communication and trust,
- is adept at communicating with both technical and non-technical client stakeholders.

We're looking for Delivery Managers that can work alongside software engineers at all levels, having engineers as peers and as direct reports, and play a key role in making sure that JUXT projects are executed well.

If you're a software engineer with a talent for leading, building relationships, unblocking teams, and thinking about the bigger picture, and you're looking to move into the management track, this role could be for you. Alternatively, if you have experience as a Delivery Manager, Account Manager, or Software Engineering Manager in a business with high technical standards and excellent modern engineering, we want to speak with you.

## Responsibilities

- Define agile planning and communication structure for software teams.
- Build strong client relationships through regular touch points.
- Act as line manager for a group of JUXT engineers, including regular 1:1s.
- Complete essential financial reporting and team admin across a small set of projects.
- Help us find and recruit the best engineers.

## Qualifications & Characteristics

Essential:

- Highly organised, self-motivated, and able to operate independently.
- Adept at applying agile thinking to minimise risk and deliver successful projects.
- Experience working as a software engineer.
- Excellent communication skills.

Useful but not essential:

- Experience in banking and fintech.
- Experience working in a software consultancy.

## Location
