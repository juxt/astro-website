## Job Description

JUXT is seeking experienced engineers to join a critical client project. You’ll be responsible for engineering core, global scale, technology assets and platforms that are secure by design, employ a zero-trust model and are built with best-in-class security controls. These stacks will be developed using modern, cloud-native principles and employ leading and open-source technologies.

This project is leading Generative AI development and integration across the bank. This includes developer enablement work as well as Gen AI-based tooling for business users. For example, the generation of database queries from free text, and the generation of client reports based on the results from these queries.

The ideal candidate is a seasoned Python developer with hands-on experience in engineering transformative solutions using open-source tech, and deep experience in varied language stacks *(Python is the main requirement, but experience in other languages would be beneficial)*. We expect candidates who apply to this role to be well versed in hybrid i.e. on-prem enterprise and cloud technologies.

## Responsibilities

- Own system building with a specific focus on AI/ML application and integration, API and communication layers across hybrid architectures that span public and private cloud
- Developing globally scaled backends, using microservices or distributed systems (we typically have services in Python, but experience in other languages would be beneficial)
- Working with PDF parsing and/or OCR (optical character recognition)
- Building data pipelines and working with large-scale, enterprise systems
- Developing robust, reusable code with a focus on core engineering, building
libraries and frameworks

## Experience required

- 5+ years’ Python programming experience, Django preferred
- GenAI and Machine Learning technologies (personal projects count too!)
- DevOps technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, preferred but not necessary
- Commercial experience working with systems at scale, handling large data sets across multiple regions
- Ability to evangelise the technology strategy vision and solutions developed thereof within a large matrixed organisation
- Strong communication skills with the ability to drive ideation and manage conflicts
- Ability to discuss complex issues with technical and non-technical audiences that include peers, product owners, and other stakeholders
