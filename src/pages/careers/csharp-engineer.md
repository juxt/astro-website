## Job Description

We’re looking for several .NET developers, from mid-level through to senior engineers, to join us on a long-term project with one of our key clients within the asset management space. 

This is a chance to work in a genuinely high-performing engineering team, helping to maintain and evolve core systems across a core asset management platform. You’ll get involved in everything from upgrading libraries and adding new features in WPF UIs, to preparing applications for a major migration of services into Azure cloud.

The work is varied and meaningful: security enhancements, CI/CD pipeline improvements (GitHub Actions), modernisation of legacy components, and hands-on development of C#/.NET services that sit at the heart of the business.

At JUXT, we take pride in partnering with clients who value engineering excellence, and this team is a standout example — technically strong, collaborative, and genuinely passionate about quality code.

## Core skills
* Strong experience with C# and .NET
* Experience with Azure
* Familiarity with cloud and DevOps technologies
* Sound engineering principles and an eye for clean, maintainable code

## Nice to have
* Experience in fintech or financial services
* Knowledge of WPF
* Knowledge of Angular
* Exposure to large-scale cloud migrations

## WFH?
These roles are hybrid — typically three days per week in the office, working closely with the team in Central London. 

## Contract type
We’re open to both permanent employees and inside IR35 contractors.

## Eligibility
We can only consider candidates who have the right to work in the UK and do not require visa sponsorship. Applicants must be UK-based and within a commutable distance of London.

## Interested?
Email careers@juxt.pro with your CV and a brief introduction. Even if you’re not sure you tick every box, we’d still love to hear from you — we’re always keen to meet passionate, technically curious developers and can keep you in mind for future projects if this one isn’t the right fit.
