# Camels, snakes and kebabs

Clojure's idiom of map keys being keywords where parts are separated by
hyphens (so called \"kebab-case\", e.g. `:book-title` or `:author-name`)
quickly starts to look normal even when coming from the wider world of
camel casing (`bookTitle`) or snake casing (`book_title`) as used widely
in other languages and data formats.

In fact, to my eyes at least, anything that is _not_ kebab-cased starts
to look a bit ugly. You'll see it with Java interop and you'll see it
when consuming data from other systems via JSON data formats and the
like.

```clojure
    (let [author-profile (:body (http/get "http://data.com/authorProfiles/1"
                                          {:as :json}))]
      {:author-name (:authorName some-data)
       :book-title (->> some-data
                        :listedPublications
                        (filter #(= "scienceFiction" (:bookCategory %)))

                        :bookTitle)})
```

Not beautiful, is it? Sometimes for a tiny integration like that we
won't be too offended, but when you interact with another system in many
different ways and transfer much larger data structures than that, it
will quickly bloat your code with nothing more than workarounds for your
preferred code style, obscuring the intent.

The [camel-snake-kebab](https://github.com/qerub/camel-snake-kebab)
library is one of my favorites. It provides conversion functions from
any style to any other style, returning keywords or strings as you
prefer. I encourage you to have a look if you're not already familiar
with it.

# Walk all the keys!

One tempting way to convert your un-idiomatic data into lovely kebabs is
by using `clojure.walk/keywordize-keys`, modified a bit to use
camel-snake-kebab as follows:

```clojure
    (defn kebab-keys
      "Recursively transforms all map keys into kebab-cased keywords."
      [m]
      (let [f (fn [[k v]] (if (string? k) [(->kebab-case-keyword k) v] [k v]))]
        ;; only apply to maps
        (postwalk (fn [x] (if (map? x) (into {} (map f x)) x)) m)))
```

Call it like `(kebab-keys author-profile)`. Satisfyingly complicated,
and does the job. Great!

# Make it work, make it fast

While this works, the performance is actually pretty bad. There are
three reasons why this might be the case: firstly, `postwalk` is
generally expensive as it will create a lot of interim data structures.
Secondly `postwalk` is expensive because it is needless - our JSON
parser has already walked the data structure while marshalling it, and
now we're doing it again. Finally, if your data structure contains
sequences of maps with the same keys then `->kebab-case-keyword` is
performing the same expensive name/regex/format/keyword operations for
the same keys over and over again.

The widely-adopted [clj-http](https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http)
library, or `clojure.jdbc` [as mentioned in a previous
post](/blog/posts/coercing) allow you to provide coercing functions
which are used within marshalling. This immediately eliminates the need
for `postwalk`.

Participating in `clj-http`'s coercion multimethod is easy:

```clojure
    (defmethod clj-http.client/coerce-response-body :json-kebab-keys [req resp]
      (clj-http.client/coerce-json-body req resp ->kebab-case-keyword false))
```

And lets us rewrite the example above using kebab keys:

```clojure
    (let [author-profile (:body (http/get "http://data.com/authorProfiles/1"
                                          {:as :json-kebab-keys}))]
      {:author-name (:author-name some-data)
       :book-title (->> some-data
                        :listed-publications
                        (filter #(= "scienceFiction" (:book-category %)))

                        :book-title)})
```

Finally, you can memoize the coercing function when you know a lot of
the keys will be identical - in the example here, imagine the author has
written hundreds of books, all of which have the same keys.

```clojure
    (defmethod clj-http.client/coerce-response-body :json-kebab-keys [req resp]
      (clj-http.client/coerce-json-body req resp (memoize ->kebab-case-keyword) false))
```

Job done. For large data structures, this will be much, much faster than
the postwalk solution above.

# Works both ways

Need to talk back to this external system? Convert back at the last
moment:

```clojure
    (http/post "http://data.com/authorProfiles"
               {:body (json/encode new-author {:key-fn (memoize ->camelCaseString)})})
```

You never even have to see camels or snakes again!
