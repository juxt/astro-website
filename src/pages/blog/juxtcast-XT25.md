We’re back with a brand new season of JUXTCast!

In Season 6, Episode 1, we bring together voices from the JUXT leadership team to reflect on recent developments and what lies ahead. CTO Malcolm Sparks, CEO Jon Pither, Chief Delivery Officer Joe Littlejohn, and Principal Consultant Farzad Pezeshkpour cover three key topics:

- Our move to a new office space in London, which marks a significant step for JUXT as we continue to grow and adapt;

- Highlights and takeaways from the XT25 Fintech Conference in London;

- A discussion on the evolving role of AI in software and finance.

This episode sets the stage for a new chapter at JUXT—blending fresh perspectives, industry insight, and a forward-looking mindset.
