At XT16 [Håkan Råberg](https://github.com/hraberg) took us on a personal
search for simplicity. He told us of his journey to write a Scheme in
x86-64 assembly, revealing what he had discovered from a technical and
philosophical viewpoint. Did he find what he was looking for? Watch his
talk to find out. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAWVcN5FMmg" title="XT16 - Håkån Råberg - The Search for Simplicity" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I hope you enjoy his talk!
