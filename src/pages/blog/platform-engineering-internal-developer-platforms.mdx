"You build it, you run it!" is still a great mantra, but how do we reduce the cognitive load on teams? We need to keep a strong sense of ownership but avoid placing the burden to understand everything (including networking, auth, compliance, database administration, and much more) on every application developer.

This is where platform engineering can help.

Starting on this path might be as simple as gathering together high-quality documentation and templates, with automation coming later. Eventually, developers should be able to focus entirely on their own domain of problems, able to follow a path 'paved with gold' to get their applications from conception to production in seconds.

In this episode of JUXTCast, we brought together experts from across JUXT’s platform projects to chat about platform engineering and what we’ve learned about building internal developer platforms.
