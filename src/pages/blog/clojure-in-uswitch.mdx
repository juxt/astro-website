## Using Clojure from the Beginning

[uSwitch](https://www.uswitch.com) is a major supporter of the [London Clojurian Community](http://www.londonclojurians.org/) having used Clojure since it's
early 1.0 days. They run regular [coding dojos](http://www.londonclojurians.org/coding-dojos/) at their offices for
newcomers to the language, and sponsor various community events and conferences
(such as [EuroClojure](http://euroclojure.org/), [ClojureBridge](http://www.clojurebridge.org/), and the [Clojure Exchange](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6861-clojure-exchange-2015)).
They frequently commit to open-source Clojure libraries and have also participated in the annual [Clojure Cup](https://twitter.com/clojurecup). The revolution at uSwitch began in 2010 after the company was acquired by [Forward Internet Group](http://forward.co.uk/). uSwitch's .NET monolithic systems were
[strangled](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html) and
subsequently replaced with a system of microservices, written in Clojure, Ruby,
Go and more. ​As with the changes to technology, the organisation also
transformed from being [functionally structured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_structure#Functional_structure)
to product-oriented; decoupling the business to make it more resilient and easier to scale.

Jones](https://twitter.com/michael_jones), [Paul
Ingles](https://twitter.com/pingles), [Ragnar Dahlen](https://twitter.com/ragge)
and [Jon Neale](https://twitter.com/jon_neale) for a spot of Q & A.

## Microservices, the Monolith and Clojure

​
**Jon Pither:** What was the relationship between Clojure and
Microservices at the beginning?

​
**Mike Jones:** Having small, independently replaceable services helped us
to explore new ways of doing things and to experiment. Another big
benefit was rewriting pieces would force us to understand the problem
better. The new service would be closer to what the business wanted. We
also found many cases of errors being present in the old system that
nobody knew about.
​
Clojure was a great fit for lots our services: the functional style of
transforming immutable data, functions that could do one thing and do it
well.
​

**Ragnar Dahlen:** Clojure's philosophy has been really influential for us
too. We really feel we've benefited not just from the language but the
community and philosophy around it.
​

**Paul Ingles:** We began taking the philosophy of clojure in the small,
at the code level, and applying it to our architecture. People in the
Clojure community were talking about immutability and composability, it
gave us a point of reference to describe what we were doing intuitively
at the system-level with Microservices.
​

## The Clojure Journey

​
**JP:** What was it like when the organisation took on Clojure and
developers had to learn it?
​

**Paul Ingles:** At Forward we used to get together to go through
[SICP](http://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf) or work through Project
Euler. By the time we'd moved over to uSwitch we'd already been inviting
more people to get stuck in. Pretty soon conferences and user groups
started to appear so we tried to support as best we could with
sponsoring, attending and ultimately, speaking.
​

**JP:** You've had Clojure expertise for a while now. How is the Clojure
code faring on some of the more mature systems?
​

**Jon Neale:** Where we have big systems they are usually sustained by the
various pieces being rewritten often. The conciseness of our Clojure
codebases helps with this, typically being around 2k lines or less.
​
Conversely we've had some code around for 4 years that hasn't changed
and is just solid.
​

**Paul Ingles:** We try to keep the individual pieces small enough that
you can reason about them in isolation. Fortunately a lot of the things
I work on these days are relatively short-lived or experimental: they
generally end up small, and with simple enough data, that we could
replace if it we ever had to.
​
Sometimes we look to replace things as we experiment with new ways of
solving the problem, shipping logs from containers is a recent example.
We've been through about 3 incarnations in as many months. Other times
stuff just works and solves the problem and we're in no rush to just go
back and replace for the sake of it.
​

## Hiring

​
**JP:** How has uSwitch found the hiring process for Clojure developers?
​

**JN:** We find that the quality of people coming through the door for
interview is generally higher. We generally get high calibre developers
interested in more than just programming, thinking beyond just their
code.
​

**MJ:** The company must then be ready to take in developers of this
mindset, to adapt to the individuals coming in who will want to make a
difference. If you don't it's just a bait-and-switch.
​

**PI:** There's no guarantees of course but the quality is generally high.
Clojure seems to be self-selecting in terms of talent, for now at least.
Every community of developers has its quirks but we're pretty happy with
the ones in the Clojure world.
​

**MJ:** We haven't had a problem finding candidates and there are some
good agencies that specialise in finding functional programmers.
Developers have also seen us at conferences and read our blogs, so we
get a few candidates approaching us wanting to do Clojure.
​

**JN:** It was different to when we first started 6 years ago. Now we find
that 70/80% of people applying have got Clojure on the CV. For us
wanting to attract top people Clojure acts as a good differentiator and
attractor.
​

## Clojure in the UK

​
**JP:** How do you think Clojure is doing in the UK?
​

**PI:** It feels like there's quite a lot of experience in London now.
Perhaps there's fewer companies shouting about working with Clojure,
although they are, just because its a bit less new now.
​

**JN:** It's definitely not just organisations used to being more
cutting-edge nowadays, more banks are using it so it feels more
mainstream.
​

**PI:** At conferences there's always a few companies I've not heard of
and definitely not just ones in London so I guess it spreading. For us
it's been brilliant and we're not likely to stop using it anytime soon.
​
The tooling and libraries have reached a level of safety where you're no
longer looking over the edge of the precipice.
​

## State of Clojure

​
**JP:** What is the feeling as to what the state of Clojure is, and what
recent or upcoming advances interest you?
​

**PI:** Clojure and the community have become so stable; the tooling and
libraries have reached a level of safety where you're no longer looking
over the edge of the precipice when you setup someone or something new.
There's all kinds of training materials, lots of books, online
exercises, and multiple conferences throughout the world.
​

**JN:** Getting a working setup is no longer an issue. Tools like [Emacs Live](https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live) and
[Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/) lower the barrier to entry and the
more heavier class of tools have tremendous refactoring support.
​
Clojure is stable. The refactoring tools still being developed are
interesting, and we'd like to try [boot](http://boot-clj.com/) and
[spec](https://clojure.org/about/spec). Maybe a big web framework is
imminent
([Arachne](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1346708779/arachne-rapid-web-development-for-clojure)
is upcoming).
​

**PI:** We probably err on the side of safer and simpler code. We're
definitely not using all language features all the time, and definitely
don't automatically adopt new tools without trying them out first.
​
In fact, when Mike Jones and I flew to Clojure-conj just as
[protocols](http://clojure.org/reference/protocols) were being added to
the language we rewrote part of the energy pricing system to use them.
By the time we'd landed we'd reverted everything back. Protocols weren't
intended to solve that problem and we realised it once we tried.
​
We really value pragmatism: solve our problems and move on. We can get a
lot done which helps the business to move faster.
