Are you thinking of taking your very first Clojure steps? Or are you
looking to get familiar with a top to bottom _stack_ that will help you
to achieve most of your goals?

Come to the joyful epicentre of 1970s UK [architectural serenity that is
Milton
Keynes](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/03/struggle-for-the-soul-of-milton-keynes)!
Come and spend an entertaining day with us in this designed city where
we will spend the whole day immersed in beautiful Clojure, either at the
beginner or seasoned professional level. When we find ourselves needing
to get our heads above the parenthesises, we have a very good
[independent coffee](http://www.bogotacoffee.co.uk/mkcoffeehouse.html)
shop and a splendid selection of [chain
restaurants](http://www.thehub-miltonkeynes.com/) to choose from for
luncheon.

Please see our [training page](/training.html) for details. We are
offering two different one-day courses. _Day 0_ is for people wanting to
use Clojure from the very beginning and _full stack_ is about creating
end to end applications using a selected set of complimentary
components; what we at JUXT are using on a regular basis.

We do charge for these public courses, but for every training place
booked we will open up a free place for someone who might otherwise not
have the opportunity to learn Clojure. If that's you or you know of
someone who could benefit, then [please let us know](/contact.html).

The first Day 0 training day is 27th March 2017, the first Full Stack is
28th March 2017.
