2017 was a busy year for JUXT - on top of the project deliveries we
achieved, we also moved our Milton Keynes office to bigger premises.

This turned out to be a good opportunity to configure our workspace a
little more to our liking. Since we're predominantly a team of
full-stack devs, we tend to agree with [others who feel open plan
offices are harmful](https://goo.gl/aVC4zm) to the focus and deep
concentration that serious programming often requires. We've embraced
walls and have split the office up into separate areas, including a
library and common room.

We've kitted the office out with standing desks. I used to suffer from
neck and upper-back problems, primarily caused by hunching over a laptop
for much of the day. I've found the switch to standing during the
mornings to be hugely beneficial and haven't had any problems recently
(should they reoccur, we have installed a wonderful
[OSIM](https://www.osim.co.uk/) uDiva massage chair in our new library).

The office is 5 minutes away walk from Milton Keynes Central, which is
30 mins from Euston Station and on the mainline between London and
Birmingham.

We've taken on 4 permanent staff this year, two of whom had no
experience with Clojure before they arrived but have thoroughly enjoyed
learning the ropes and picking up tips from some of our more experienced
devs.

Besides hiring for our Milton Keynes office, we also have roles
available in Central London, where we'll soon be opening a new
development centre.

Along with some of the day-to-day perks of working for a tech company,
we are also planning a fantastic mini-conference (in a remote hunting
lodge in Burgundy, France) this year (GT18) which all employees will be
involved in.

We're (still) a small tight-knit crew, but growing steadily and taking
on some new exciting projects this year. If you'd like to join us,
checkout our [careers page](/careers.html).
We'd love to hear from you.
