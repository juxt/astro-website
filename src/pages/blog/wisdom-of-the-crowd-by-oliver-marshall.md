I built this presentation as a bit of an experiment.

The idea was simple. Could I recreate a “wisdom of the crowd” demo live, using nothing more than a few hours of AI-assisted development and everyone’s mobile phones over WiFi?

The theory is familiar. If you ask a large group to estimate something obscure, their errors cancel out. Biases balance. The average converges toward the truth. It’s elegant. It’s reassuring. It makes us feel that collectives are smarter than individuals.

So I built a small interactive system where everyone could submit answers in real time. The tech came together surprisingly quickly. AI helped scaffold the environment, wire up the inputs, and get something usable running in an afternoon. From a tooling perspective, it was smooth.

What followed was not.

Instead of a calm statistical convergence, we discovered something else: our colleagues are united in their diversity. Which is to say, united in their determination to disagree. The ability to broadcast emoji added a layer of chaos that the original wisdom-of-crowds papers did not quite prepare us for.

At one point, I quietly seeded an early answer to see whether a confident signal would steer the group toward the truth. It did not. If anything, it made people more suspicious. Developers, it turns out, prefer to form their own opinions.

The people misbehaved. The system did not.

That was probably the most interesting outcome of all. AI made it easy to build the platform. Human behaviour made it impossible to predict.
