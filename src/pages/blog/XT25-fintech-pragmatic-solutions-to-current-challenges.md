As part of the [XT25 Fintech Conference](https://www.juxt.pro/xt25/), one of the most engaging sessions of the day was the Expert Panel discussion: Pragmatic Solutions to Current Challenges.

Moderated by Steve Pegg (Head of Risk and P&L Technology at [Qube Research & Technologies](https://www.qube-rt.com/)), the panel brought together senior leaders and practitioners tackling real-world issues in trading platforms, risk systems, and applied AI.

Panelists included:

- Zohar Melamed | Qube Research & Technologies | Quantitative Technical Director

- Fuzz (Farzad) Pezeshkpour | JUXT | Principal Consultant

- Building resilient infrastructure in volatile markets

- Cross-team collaboration between quant, tech, and ops

The session offered candid, insightful views from those building and operating the tech behind today’s financial markets—focusing not on theoretical futures, but on what’s actually working now.
