# _What is wrong with native app development?_

I've always enjoyed writing mobile apps (although I considered it being
way harder than it should be). The combination of complex build tools,
monster IDEs, proprietary software, slow feedback cycle and terrible API
designs, seemed to conjure endless obstacles between me and the app I am
developing.

When React Native came out I hoped it would bring an end to this
suffering, but it turned out to be yet one more layer of complexity on
top of a broken ecosystem. After the announcement of [Create React
Native
Apps](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/03/13/introducing-create-react-native-app.html)
and Facebook collaborating with Expo I can now say the entry barrier to
native apps is as low as writing a web app.

# _How does Expo fix it?_

[Expo](https://docs.expo.io/) takes the bold stance of not allowing you
to write any native code at all. Together with React Native, it exposes
a JS-only SDK wrapping of most of the native API's, and then runs your
app inside the Expo client. This means you cannot perform sophisticated
hardware control (but most likely, you won't need to if you stick with
basic audio/video/bluetooth controls). Then, you can write a pure JS app
that gets rendered with native components.

The experience has been crafted extremely well. You only need to learn a
smaller, more coherent set of API's and you are able to write a more
compact and easier to maintain code. More importantly, you can choose
your own development tools, since you don't need to own a Macbook or
install Android Studio to run it. Your app is dynamically fetched and
updated on the fly, so there is no need to go through a complex release
process and distributing it is as convenient as sharing a link.

In the past I have used [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) and
similar strategies to write apps in pure JS, but the result was never
on-par with a native app. With Expo, you really get the best of both
worlds.

# _Just how easy it is to add ClojureScript to Expo?_

Let's see. Start by creating a fresh expo project:

    npm i -g exp
    mkdir foo && cd foo && exp init -t blank
    npm install

Then add the following ClojureScript files

In `foo/src/app/core.cljs`

```clj
(ns app.core)

(def React (js/require "react"))
(def ReactNative (js/require "react-native"))
(def Expo (js/require "expo"))

(def createFactory (aget React "createFactory"))
(def createClass (aget React "createClass"))
(def registerRootComponent (aget Expo "registerRootComponent"))

(def Text (createFactory (aget ReactNative "Text")))

(def style
  #js {
    :flex 1
    :fontSize 18
    :paddingTop 80
    :textAlign "center"
  })

(def App (createClass #js {:render #(Text. #js {:style style} "Hello from Cljs")}))

(registerRootComponent App)
```

In `foo/build.cljs`

```clj
(require '[lumo.build.api :as b])

(b/build "src"
  {:output-to "main.js"
   :optimizations :advanced})
```

Compile your cljs files using
[`lumo`](https://anmonteiro.com/2017/02/compiling-clojurescript-projects-without-the-jvm/)
and serve the app:

    npm i -g lumo-cljs
    lumo -c src build.cljs
    exp start

Congrats! You now can run a ClojureScript app on iOS from a Linux laptop
with just `node` installed!

A good exercise is to try and convert some simple examples to
ClojureScript, like those you find in the [Snack
playground](https://blog.expo.io/sketch-a-playground-for-react-native-16b2401f44a2).
If you're feeling lazy, you can simply clone this
[repo](https://github.com/frankiesardo/lumo-expo) which also shows
continuous deployment done via Travis CI.

# _Where do you go from here?_

Just like every other Clojure developer you're probably very spoiled
because you came to rely on powerful tools:

- Fast compilation times

- Hot code reload

- Device REPL

In order to use this toolchain you need to bring in `leiningen` and/or
`boot` and the setup is a bit more convoluted. Fortunately, the
community already has developed a
[template](https://github.com/tiensonqin/exponent-cljs-template) where
all these problems have been solved for you. Obviously, it has many more
moving parts compared to the simpler setup above, but it _just works_

# _Is it production ready?_

ClojureScript moves fast and there are already various apps in
production built this way.

- [lymchat](http://www.lymchat.com/) is authored by the same author of
  the template and it's [open
  source](https://github.com/tiensonqin/lymchat-exp).

- [Centriq](https://www.centriqhome.com/) was recently presented in a
  talk during [Clojure
  West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHQAMrShHu8) and also
  integrates with GraphQL.

You will find plenty of resources on [cljsrn.org](http://cljsrn.org/) to
help you writing ClojureScript apps with React Native. Everything from
the newest [React Navigation](https://github.com/vikeri/re-navigate)
library to a [Graphql](https://github.com/retro/graphql-builder) client
can be easily adaptable to your needs. It's early days but I feel
ClojureScript + Expo is one of the best options for building large,
sophisticated apps on mobile.

**1** Big shout out to `tiensonqin` for putting this together and to
every other person hanging around in the `#cljsrn` channel for this
massive achievement. It's incredible how much has been done by the
community with small, incremental contributions.
