The final chapter in our Foundations series distils the best dayâ€‘one habits I teach every new Go hire. Each tip is intentionally biteâ€‘sized: copy, paste, move on.

## 1 Â· Keep the Folder Flat

Start with just `main.go` and `go.mod`. Add subâ€‘packages only when duplication forces your hand.

```
myâ€‘service/
  â”œâ”€ go.mod
  â”œâ”€ main.go
  â””â”€ README.md
```

Why: Shallow trees cut import churn and merge conflicts. Grow `internal/` or `pkg/` later.

## 2 Â· Trust the Builtâ€‘In Tooling

| Task   | Command          |
|--------|------------------|
| Run app | `go run ./...`  |
| Format | `go fmt ./...`   |
| Test   | `go test ./...`  |
| Vet    | `go vet ./...`   |

Skip custom Makefiles until you truly need them.

## 3 Â· Check Errors Immediately

Never ignore the returned error.

```go
if err := svc.Start(); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

Either handle or propagateâ€”no silent `_ = fn()`.

## 4 Â· Pass `context.Context` First

Any function that can block or hit the network should start with `ctx`.

```go
func FetchUser(ctx context.Context, id int) (*User, error) { â€¦ }
```

Enables cancel, timeout, tracing, metrics.

## 5 Â· Concrete Types First, Interfaces Later

Implement logic against real structs. Extract an interface only when a second implementation appears.

Smells to watch: `FooService` interface on day zero, no mocks or alt impls in sight.

## 6 Â· Initialise Collections Explicitly

Slices, maps, channels have writeâ€‘unsafe zero values.

```go
users := make([]User, 0, 100)
cache := make(map[string]*Item)
```

## 7 Â· Lint Early, Format Always

Add to `go.tools` (VSÂ Code) or run manually:

```bash
go vet ./...
# optional megaâ€‘linter
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangciâ€‘lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin v1.56.0
golangciâ€‘lint run ./...
```

Use `goimports` to autoâ€‘add/remove imports on save.

## 8 Â· Pick One Structured Logger and Commit

`zap` for raw speed, `zerolog` for fewer depsâ€”both JSONâ€‘native.

```go
log := zerolog.New(os.Stdout).With().Timestamp().Logger()
```

Standardise the format early; grep and dashboards thank you later.

## 9 Â· Write Small, Focused Unit Tests

Keep tests fast (<2Â s). Mock only meaningful collaborators.

```go
func TestPriceWithDiscount(t *testing.T) {
    got := PriceWithDiscount(100, 0.1)
    want := 90
    if got != want { t.Errorf("got %d want %d", got, want) }
}
```

Integration tests have valueâ€”just not in your save loop.

## Pocket Checklist

- Flat folder, two files.
- Builtâ€‘ins: run, fmt, test, vet.
- Always check error.
- `context` goes first.
- Concrete > interface.
- `make` collections.
- `go vet` + `golangciâ€‘lint`.
- One logger â†’ everywhere.
- Unit tests under two seconds.

Print, laminate, tape to monitor.
