Helping companies with technology adoption is where I've failed the most in my career.

I've simultaineously underestimated the challenge and overestimated my ability to meet it. But I'm not alone, discussing this with a prominent technical author of several reknown books, he framed it for me: _'Organizations don't change, people do'_.

That's a loaded statement, that requires some unpacking. Of course organizations _do_ change, through evolution and sometimes revolution. Just like the cultures contained with countries. Evolution of cultural norms happens over the years as existing cultural norms are challenged and new ones are formed as they gather consensus.

Cultural norms are hard-won, and they offer people reassurance against uncertainty, anxiety and stress. A foundation of strong cultural norms allows for people to feel safe, and conversely for experimentation to happen, and for new evolution of norms to form to happen.

Previously, I hadn't understood this. When you're bringing forward a technology change programme to a business, you're challenging the existing cultural norms. You're going to meet resistance, that won't be overcome by simply stating that technology X is better than technology Y. The questions for significant change will go deep, and the path will be _difficult_.

I'm often embroiled introducing a switch-up of programming languages. I continue to believe this can make a huge productivity differenced, but I now recognise that the programming language is just the tip of the iceberg. A technology organization will or die on whether or not it empowers its technologists, and if it meets the basic hierarchy of needs such as good pay, recognition, and making employees feel safe and trusted. The choice of technology is simultaineously a critical thing to get right, but also not the most critical.

An anology I've used in past, admittedly not the most helpful, is of deckchairs on sinking cruiseliners. Technology adoption programmes layered on top of broken cultures aren't going to succeed.

Where a culture is strong, built on a foundation of mutual trust, responsibility and accountability, with an embrace of innovation for continuous improvement, then technology adoption will not be anything new. An outside agency, like a software consultancy, will just be providing ideas and demonstrations, having been gained from a variety of external perspectives.

But what of revolution? What if a the culture of a company has hit a dead-end, is in acceptance of this, and wants a reboot?

I've seen this in action, and I've a growing respect for the idea of 'Programmer Anarchy', pioneered by Fred George, who I once worked for. Where I saw it in action, there was buy-in from all the existing employees, and by a healthy measure of new joiners also. It was an agreed upon adventure.

The risk born out is that revolutions are messy. Many initatives will die out over differing lengths of time. These will sap energy and can create rancour. And yet over time, the bigger picture can still win out. If the company ends up with a better culture using more modern, efficient and productive technologies, with an empowered and trustful team at the end of it, then it will be have been worth it. Programmer Anarchy above all requires strong senior leadership to provide air cover and to follow the course.

If you're determined to push for adopting technologies as a jolt rather than an explosion, then my failures have taught me the merits of a conservative approach. I'm done with the narcissistic self-labelling of being a 'change agent', that doomed to fail. I aspire to be one of the bridge-builders, long term and system thinkers, who effect change in a responsible and measured way, supporting the pillars of standards and governance.

A mistake I've made, more than once, is to apply change as though it's a closing window of opportunity. I've wanted to push in a stack of technology choices, hoping to win the argument with deus-ex machina, where the more sophisticated and capable the tech is, the better.

It doesn't work. Technology choices _are_ cultural norms, and existing cultural norms aren't surrended or easily formed. The bigger the breaking change, the bigger the resistance. 'Just wtf is this, he wants us to do _this_ now?'.

Even if impactful, stark technology adoption choices survive, they remain fragile. When broader challenges emerge to the organisation, be it of process, staff retention, or economic, then there is a human drive to apply conservatism and to stick to the orthodox. This is more true of larger organisations, where maintaining a common culture is harder, and the tragectory is to become more conservative, not less.

A conversative approach means introducing technologies slowly, one at a time, bringing people along with you. Win trust by delivering against business goals early on, avoiding technology for technology's sake, showing it's viable to 'beat the averages'.

Take a long term view of the company's position, and understand what the technology choices mean for when you are no longer there. What would it look like for hiring, for developers transitioning across teams, and for complying with existing and emerging company standards? Can your new techologies easily be _replaced_?

Organizations don't change the way you want them to, but there is a well of hope you can draw from whilst you take it slow.

Early on in my career, in a consulting project that was dubbed 'organizational transformation', I was dispirited by our lack of success in driving through the _revolution_, that would have helped the company more quickly modernize. In a conversation with a colleague, I had a 'what are we really doing?' moment. What he said stuck with me, that the people I'd been pairing with, teaching TDD or whatever it was back then, that we had enriched their lives, given them new skills, and wasn't that a thing to be proud of?

Organizations may not change, but people do.
