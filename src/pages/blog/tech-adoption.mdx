Helping companies with technology adoption is where I've failed the most in my career.

I've simultaineously underestimated the challenge and overestimated my ability to meet it. But I'm not alone, discussing this with a prominent technical author of several reknown books, he framed it for me: _'Organizations don't change, people do'_.

That's a loaded statement, that requires some unpacking. Of course organizations _do_ change, through evolution and sometimes revolution. Just like the cultures contained with countries. Evolution of cultural norms happens over the years as existing cultural norms are challenged and new ones are formed as they gather consensus.

Cultural norms are hard-won, and they offer people reassurance against uncertainty, anxiety and stress. A foundation of strong cultural norms allows for people to feel safe, and conversely for experimentation to happen, and for new evolution of norms to form.

Previously, I hadn't understood this. When you're bringing forward a technology change programme to a business, you're challenging the existing cultural norms. You're going to meet resistance, that won't be overcome by simply stating that technology X is better than technology Y. The questions for significant change will go deep, and the path will be _difficult_.

I'm often embroiled introducing a switch-up of programming languages, that I continue to believe offer huge productivity gains. It's just that now I recognise that the programming language is just the tip of the iceberg. A technology organization will or die on whether or not it empowers its technologists, and if it meets the basic hierarchy of needs such as good pay, recognition, and making employees feel safe and trusted. The choice of technology is simultaineously a critical thing to get right, but also not the most critical.

An anology I've used in past, admittedly not the most helpful, is of deckchairs on sinking cruiseliners. Technology adoption programmes layered on top of broken cultures aren't going to succeed.

Where a culture is strong, built on a foundation of mutual trust, responsibility and accountability, with an embrace of innovation for continuous improvement, then technology adoption will not be anything new. An outside agency, like a software consultancy, will just be providing ideas and demonstrations, they themselves having been gained from a variety of external perspectives.

But what of revolution? What if a the culture of a company has hit a dead-end, is in acceptance of this, and wants a reboot?

I've seen this in action, and I've a growing respect for the idea of 'Programmer Anarchy', pioneered by Fred George, who I once worked for. Where I saw it, there was buy-in from the existing employees, and the new joiners also. It was an agreed upon adventure.

The risk born out is that revolutions are messy. Many initatives will die out over differing lengths of time. These will sap energy and can create rancour. And yet over time, the bigger picture can still win out. If the company ends up with a better culture using more modern, efficient and productive technologies, with an empowered and trustful team at the end of it, then the strife will be have been worth it. Programmer Anarchy above all requires strong senior leadership to provide air cover and to maintain the course.

If you're determined to push for adopting technologies as a jolt rather than an unmitigated explosion, then my errors have taught me the merits of a conservative approach. I will resist the draw of being labeled as a 'change agent', and instead aspire to be one of the bridge-builders, long term and system thinkers, who effect change in a responsible and measured way, and in doing so will re-enforce the existing pillars of standards and governance.

A further mistake I've made, is to apply change as though it's a closing window of opportunity. I've wanted to push in a stack of technology choices, hoping to win the argument with deus-ex machina, where the more powerful the tech is, the better.

It doesn't work. Technology choices _are_ cultural norms, and existing cultural norms aren't surrended or easily formed. The bigger the proposition, the bigger the resistance.

Even if impactful, stark technology adoption choices survive, they remain fragile. When broader challenges emerge to the organisation, be it of process, staff retention, or economic, then there is a human drive to apply conservatism and to veer towards orthodoxy throughout. This is more true of larger organisations, where maintaining a common culture is more difficult still, and therefore the trajectory is to increase conservatism.

To introduce the change we want, we must align with the inherent conservatism in the situation, and build from there. This means introducing technologies slowly, one at a time, and bringing people along with us. Trust is won by delivering against business goals early on, demonstrating that we're not just choosing technology for technology's sake, but rather making clear and tangible gains for the business. We want to show it's viable to 'beat the averages' after all.

We require empathy and of the company's long term position. What are the ramifications for when the people introducing new technologies have moved on? What will it look like for hiring? Will developers from across the company be able to transition across teams? Do new technologies comply with existing and emerging standards? Are they secure? Can your new technologies easily be _replaced_?

It's no surprise to anyone, that technology adoption is hard. Against these difficulties there's also the sheer inertia of the situation. There are _many_ different technology choices out there, and so who is to say which one is better? The end-choice has to be compelling to the team(s) who will live it, and this embrace will take time.

There is however a well of hope you can draw from whilst you take it slow.

Early on in my career, in a consulting project that was dubbed 'organizational transformation', I was dispirited by our lack of success in driving through a _revolution_. During a conversation with a colleague, I had a _'what are we really doing?'_ moment. What he responded with stuck with me, that the people I'd been pairing with, teaching TDD or whatever it was back then, that we had enriched their lives and given them new skills, and wasn't that a thing to be proud of?

Organizations may not really change, but people do.
