In this Safari session, I share my personal journey with Rust, exploring both the rewarding and challenging aspects of the language. I delve into what sets Rust apart from Clojure, highlighting the similarities and key differences I have encountered along the way. From its unique ownership model to the guarantees of memory safety, I reflect on how these features shaped my experience.

I have come to realise that Rust and Clojure are quite complimentary to each other. Areas where Rust fades have quite a bit of overlap with Clojure's strengths and vice-versa.

Learning Rust over the past 7 months has been a great roller-coaster ride and will hopefully also help me improve my Clojure skills!
