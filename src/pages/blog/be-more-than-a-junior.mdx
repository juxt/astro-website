## Work with charts

Ok, this one might seem a bit random, but I've noticed that it has greatly helped my junior devs.
I believe it's a good exercise because most charting libraries force you to provide data in an unlabelled format,
which isn't necessarily what you get from a database or an api.

This means that you need to come up with a way of aletering the data to fit the charting library's needs,
giving you familiarity with the whole data transformation process.

### Small example

Let's assume we need a chart that shows the daily temparature range and average for a given period of time. Something like this:

import rangeChart from '../../assets/blog/range-chart.jpg'

<Image src={rangeChart} />

If we were to use a charting library like [highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/), we would need to provide the data in the following format:

```ts
// An array of tuples containing min, max for a given day
const temperatureRange = [
  [15, 28],
  [12, 22],
  [13, 22],
  [17, 26]
  ...
]

// An array of numbers containing the average temperature for a given day
const average = [21.5, 17, 17.5, 21.5, ...]
```

In contrast, the data we get from an API is usually labelled and could look like this:

```ts
const data = [
  {
    min: 15,
    max: 28,
  },
  {
    min: 12,
    max: 22,
  },
  {
    min: 13,
    max: 22,
  },
  {
    min: 17,
    max: 26,
  },
  ...
]
```

It can happen that we don't get all the attributes we need. In this case, we would need to calculate the average ourselves.

To generate the two final arrays for the chart, we could use `reduce` and iterate only once over the data:

```ts
const { temperature, avg } = data.reduce(
  ({ temperature, avg }, { min, max }) => {
    return {
      temperature: [...temperature, [min, max]],
      avg: [...avg, (min + max) / 2]
    }
  },
  { temperature: [], avg: [] }
)
```

The `temperature` and `avg` arrays are now ready to be passed to the charting library.
If you struggled to understand this implementation, try implementing some line, pie, or scatter charts yourself.
You can use random data like [this](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highcharts/highcharts@24912efc85/samples/data/olympic2012.json).
Repeating this exercise multiple times will definitely strengthen your data processing skills.

## Know how `reduce` works

Juniors love the `map` function. They immediately become very familiar with it and tend to use it to solve all sorts of problems.
That's fine until they need to aggregate. It could be a sum, a count, group by, etc. map alone can't help here.

There's many libraries out there that can solve the problem with a single function call, and I encourage you to use them.
But, to level up your skills you should know how to aggregate data yourself.
For my personal growth, understading how to `reduce` was a game changer.

There's unlimited resources on the topic online that do a much better job at explaining it than I ever could.
Therefore, the only thing I will share is what helped in my personal journey.

I believe that I was on the right path to master `reduce` when I realized that it allows the manipulation of any data structure into whatever shape you want.
No limitations.
You might start from an array of objects and end up with an object of arrays,
or you might have an object of nested objects and end up with an array of strings or a single number.
The sky's the limit.

This naturally leads to the next point.

## Know your input and ouput

If you think in terms of data-in and data-out, it becomes easier to split the task in smaller, more manageable blocks.
Before writing any line of code, you must know what your final data structure will look like.
In fact, I advise you to write it down and keep an eye on it as you go through your logic.

## Quick feedback loop

I can't stress enough the importance of this point.
When prototyping some logic, you want to be able to see the results as soon as possible without having to run the whole program or leave the editor.

This is where the REPL comes in handy.
Coming from the Clojure world, I'm used to having a REPL integrated in my editor, so sketching and testing some logic is a breeze.

In other languages, there's tools that provide a similar experience.
For example, in Javascript or Typescript you can use [quokka.js](https://quokkajs.com/), a plugin for VSCode.
The free version gives you some basic features that I think are enough to get going.
That's what I've used anyways for the code I've written in the next sections.

## A Real Life Problem

THe purpose of this section is to show you one of the ways to approach and solve a real problem, and I hope you can learn something from it.

I've recently been working on a project that required some data to be displayed in a table.
More precisely, the table would show a bunch of information about some users, including their `name`, `age`, and `city`.

### The Objective

The requirements specified that the table should only include data of **the top 10 oldest users** out of tens of thousands of them.
The users would be fetched from a REST API, and would be returned in the following shape:

```ts
const source = {
  age: {
    user1: 23,
    user2: 19,
    ...
    user40000: 34
  },
  name: {
    user1: 'Paul',
    user2: 'Marty',
    ...
    user40000: 'Sophie'
  },
  city: {
    user1: 'London',
    user2: 'Rome',
    ...
    user40000: 'Tokyo'
  },
  email: {
    user1: 'paul@gmail.com',
    user2: 'marty@gmail.com',
    ...
    user40000: 'sophie@gmail.com'
  }
  ...
}
```

At this point, I encourage you to open your editor of choice and have a go at solving this problem on your own, before continuing with the article.
It's a good exercise to assess your current level of familiarity with data structures.

In the following paragraphs, I will be breaking down the problem into smaller chunks, and will explain the thought process behind each step.
Let's get our hands dirty!

### Recreating a small data sample

Unless you already have a clear idea of how to tackle the problem, I would recommend mocking a minimal version of the data, as it's easier to reason about and debug.
Therefore, let's simply work with the following representation:

```ts
const data = {
  age: {
    user1: 23,
    user2: 19,
    user3: 22,
    user4: 24,
    user5: 89
  },
  name: {
    user1: 'Paul',
    user2: 'Marty',
    user3: 'Jon',
    user4: 'Alex',
    user5: 'Sophie'
  },
  city: {
    user1: 'London',
    user2: 'Rome',
    user3: 'New York',
    user4: 'San Francisco',
    user5: 'Tokyo'
  }
}
```

The simplified version only contains 5 users and 3 properties: `age`, `name`, and `city`.
Of course the actual data contains many more users and properties, but it doesn't matter as the logic will be the same, so let's keep it simple.

### Input -> Output

Let's stop one second and understand what we are dealing with.

The starting data, which we can refer to as the input, features an object whose keys are the user properties.
Each property is an object containing key value pairs representing the user id and the corresponding value for that property.

It's not really the best shape we could have hoped for. Ideally, we would like to have an array of objects, where each object represents a user like the following:

```ts
const desiredDataSigh = [
  {
    id: 'user1',
    age: 23,
    name: 'Paul',
    city: 'London'
  },
  {
    id: 'user2',
    age: 19,
    name: 'Marty',
    city: 'Rome'
  },
  ...
]
```

Why? Because it's already in the right shape for our table, hence requiring fewer transformations. Less code, less bugs.

However, we don't have control over what the API returns, so we have to work with what we have to generate the desired output, which will look exactly like this:

```ts
const output = [
  {
    id: 'user5',
    age: 89,
    name: 'Sophie',
    city: 'Tokyo'
  },
  {
    id: 'user4',
    age: 24,
    name: 'Alex',
    city: 'San Francisco'
  },
  {
    id: 'user1',
    age: 23,
    name: 'Paul',
    city: 'London'
  },
  {
    id: 'user3',
    age: 22,
    name: 'Jon',
    city: 'New York'
  },
  {
    id: 'user2',
    age: 19,
    name: 'Marty',
    city: 'Rome'
  }
]
```

### Getting the steps down

After having written down what input and output should look like, we can start thinking of a decent algorithm for the task. What does 'decent' mean? Well, our code should:

- be readable
- be maintainable
- not take forever to run (performance)

Without experience, it might take several iterations to get the right logic in place, and it can surely get frustrating. I've been there, but it's all part of the learning process.

So, what do we do to **keep the 10 oldest users** for the table?

- sort by age
- take first 10

### Visualizing the implementation

Before attempting a solution, I think it's valuable to mentally visualize an abstracted version of the implementation we want to go for, so if there are any flaws in the logic, we can try to catch them early on.

Starting from the sorting step, we want to get the nested `age` object and sort the key value pairs in descending order.

```json
// from this shape
{
  "age": {
    "user1": 23,
    "user2": 19,
    "user3": 22,
    "user4": 24,
    "user5": 89
  }
}

// to this shape
[
  ["user5", 89],
  ["user4", 24],
  ["user1", 23],
  ["user3", 22],
  ["user2", 19]
]
```

Then, we can take the first 10 elements of the array. From now on, let's assume we want the top 3 elements, as we don't have enough mock data.

I am sure you noticed that with our transformation we only have the user id and the age, but we need all the other properties as well.
The good news is that they can be easily retrieved from the original data object using the user id.

To better explain, for each user id in the sorted array, we want some code that will return an object containing the user `id`, the `age`, the `name`, and the `city`.

### Implementing a solution

With a plan, let's write some code!

```ts
// This is the input data
const data = {
  age: {
    user1: 23,
    user2: 19,
    user3: 22,
    user4: 24,
    user5: 89
  },
  name: {
    user1: 'Paul',
    user2: 'Marty',
    user3: 'Jon',
    user4: 'Alex',
    user5: 'Sophie'
  },
  city: {
    user1: 'London',
    user2: 'Rome',
    user3: 'New York',
    user4: 'San Francisco',
    user5: 'Tokyo'
  }
}

// Let's sort the age object.
// We can use the `Object.entries` method to get an array of key value pairs,
// and then sort it using the `sort` method.
const userAges = Object.entries(data.age)

const sortedUserIdsByAge = userAges.sort(
  ([_id1, age1], [_id2, age2]) => age2 - age1
)
// output => [['user5', 89], ['user4', 24], ['user1', 23], ['user3', 22], ['user2', 19]]

// Let's take the first 3 elements of the sorted array
const firstThreeUsers = .slice(0, 3)
// output => [['user5', 89], ['user4', 24], ['user1', 23]]

// Now we have the final list of user ids, but we need to get the other properties as well.
// We can use the `map` method to iterate over the array and return an object
// containing the user id, the age, the name, and the city.
const output = firstThreeUsers.map(([id, age]) => ({
  id: id,
  age: age,
  name: data.name[id],
  city: data.city[id],
}));
// output =>
// [ { id: 'user5', age: 89, name: 'Sophie', city: 'Tokyo' },
//   { id: 'user4', age: 24, name: 'Alex', city: 'San Francisco' },
//   { id: 'user1', age: 23, name: 'Paul', city: 'London' } ]
```

Are we missing something?
What happens if we have more attributes in the input data like `email` and `phone`?

Let's remind ourselves that we don't know in advanced the user properties, so we need to tweak our code to be more flexible.
The sorting and the slicing steps are not affected, so we only have to rewrite our `output` variable.

```ts
// Let's extract all the attributes from the data object
const attributes = Object.keys(data)

// Let's leverage reduce to iterate over the attributes and return our final object
const output = firstThreeUsers.map(([id]) => {
  return attributes.reduce((acc, attribute) => {
    return {
      ...acc,
      [attribute]: data[attribute][id]
    }
  }, {})
})
```

As a final step, we can group all our logic in a single pure function, so it can be easily called with different inputs.

```ts
const data = {
  age: {
    user1: 23,
    user2: 19,
    user3: 22,
    user4: 24,
    user5: 89
  },
  name: {
    user1: 'Paul',
    user2: 'Marty',
    user3: 'Jon',
    user4: 'Alex',
    user5: 'Sophie'
  },
  city: {
    user1: 'London',
    user2: 'Rome',
    user3: 'New York',
    user4: 'San Francisco',
    user5: 'Tokyo'
  },
  email: {
    user1: 'email1',
    user2: 'email2',
    user3: 'email3',
    user4: 'email4',
    user5: 'email5'
  }
}

function sortInDescOrder(obj) {
  return Object.entries(obj).sort(([_id1, num1], [_id2, num2]) => num2 - num1)
}

function take(n, arr) {
  return arr.slice(0, n)
}

function takeOldestUsers(n, data) {
  const firstNUsers = take(n, sortInDescOrder(data.age))
  const attributes = Object.keys(data)

  return firstNUsers.map(([id]) => {
    return attributes.reduce((acc, attribute) => {
      return {
        ...acc,
        [attribute]: data[attribute][id]
      }
    }, {})
  })
}

takeOldestUsers(3, data)
// output =>
// [ { age: 89, name: 'Sophie', city: 'Tokyo', email: 'email5' },
//   { age: 24, name: 'Alex', city: 'San Francisco', email: 'email4' },
//   { age: 23, name: 'Paul', city: 'London', email: 'email1' } ]

takeOldestUsers(1, data)
// output =>
// [ { age: 89, name: 'Sophie', city: 'Tokyo', email: 'email5' } ]
```

#### Is the code readable?

It is pretty straightforward and self explanatory, so I would say yes.

#### Is it maintainable?

The logic is separated in different steps, which can be easily refactored or swapped with other functions when needed.

For example, if the sorting logic changes, we can replace the `sortInDescOrder` function with a different one,
leaving the rest of the code untouched.

#### Is it fast?

The code is not optimized for performance, but it is not slow either. With our large dataset, it would perform well.

#### What about tests?

If you take a second look at the final version of the code, you will notice that it is already in a testable shape.
Just test the `takeOldestUsers` with different inputs and you are good to go.
