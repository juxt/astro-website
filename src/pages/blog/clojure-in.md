At JUXT we want to understand how Clojure is being adopted across our
industry. As a Clojure consultancy we get asked recurring questions from
those curious about Clojure and this has prompted us to create a
resource that people can use; a set of reference case-studies addressing
common concerns and highlighting how companies have gone about building
Clojure-based systems.

Throughout the series we will focus on areas such as hiring, training,
and where the _sweet spot_ might be for the language. We will ask
companies about current state of Clojure adoption in their regional
area, and we will ask them about what they think of recent developments
in Clojure itself.

We have spoken to a range of different companies and it's been a genuine
pleasure to see where Clojure has made a difference, to talk with people
with a stake in the game that have taken a risk on a relatively new
technology in order to seek a competitive edge.

It is our hope that this collection of reference case-studies will
contribute to companies making an informed choice on adopting Clojure.
We will be releasing case-studies over the coming weeks.

We start with a focus on [Aviso in
Ireland](/blog/posts/clojure-in-aviso.html) and [uSwitch in London,
UK](/blog/posts/clojure-in-uswitch.html). Be sure to stay tuned for
more.
