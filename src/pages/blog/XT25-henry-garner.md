On June 12th, 2025, JUXT held its [XT25 Fintech Conference](https://www.juxt.pro/xt25/) in London.

The full-day conference featured talks and fireside chats with notable engineering leaders and tech innovators at the forefront of banking, fintech, and hedge funds.

We are now excited to share the first in a series of recorded talks from the event.

Henry Garner, Principal Engineer at JUXT, delivers a compelling session:
'From Unstructured to Actionable AI-Powered Regulatory Intelligence'. In this talk, Henry explores how AI and LLMs can help transform complex, unstructured regulatory data into usable, trustworthy knowledgeâ€”helping financial institutions move from compliance burden to strategic insight.
