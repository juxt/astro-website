For over a decade, JUXT has been synonymous with first-class engineering and unforgettable conferences.

This May 9th, we're taking it up a notch with [XT24](https://www.juxt.pro/xt24/) – a premier in-person event dedicated to innovation in Fintech.

Join Fintech engineering leaders, as we meet in Milton Keynes for a day filled with tech presentations, discussions, insights, and networking.

But don't just take our word for it. Let's take a trip down memory lane to our last year's extravaganza at London's historic Wilton’s Music Hall. Picture a vibrant atmosphere buzzing with industry luminaries, thought leaders, and tech innovators, discussing best practices, emerging trends, challenges, and innovative approaches in building modern software applications.
