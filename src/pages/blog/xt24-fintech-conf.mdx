For over a decade, JUXT has been synonymous with first-class engineering and unforgettable conferences.

This May 9th, we're taking it up a notch with [XT24](https://www.juxt.pro/xt24/) – a premier in-person event dedicated to innovation in Fintech.

Join Fintech engineering leaders, as we meet in Milton Keynes for a day filled with tech presentations, discussions, insights, and networking.

Whether you explore the latest in retail or investment banking tech, navigate risk management systems, or tackle the complexities of commodities trading and hedge fund IT, XT24 Conf is a great opportunity to learn from and network with industry peers.
