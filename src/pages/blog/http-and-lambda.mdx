The requirement that this blog post fulfils is:
As a developer, I want to know:

- What different ways are there I can call a lambda over HTTP
- For each of those:
  - What is the formats of requests and responses?
  - What happens if the request/response is in the wrong format?
  - What happens if exceptions are thrown?
  - What other quirks are there?
    And I want to have it all in one place.

*/}

There are three different methods to call an AWS Lambda over HTTP externally:
[Function URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-urls.html),
[Application Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html)
(ALBs)
and [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)

As I investigated each I found they had slightly different behaviours, quirks
and setup instructions. I ended up with 20+ tabs open and even wrote bunch of
test cases to learn more. I thought I would collect all that together in one
place to share with you all (and my future self).

## Methodology

While researching, the questions tried to answer were:

1. How do I set this up?
2. What are the input and output formats?
3. What happens if I don't use those formats?
4. What happens if an exception is thrown?
5. What other quirks do I notice?

Mostly I can link you to the relevant section of the docs, but for some
questions I needed to run experiments. The tests I ran were:

| Test                  | Command                                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Valid JSON request    | `curl -v -XPOST --data '{}' <url under test>`                          |
| Invalid JSON request  | `curl -v -XPOST --data '{'  <url under test>`                          |
| Valid JSON response   | Covered by that first test                                             |
| Invalid JSON response | `curl -v -XPOST --data '{}' --header 'Test: invalid' <url under test>` |
| Exception thrown      | `curl -v -XPOST --data '{}' --header 'Test: error'   <url under test>` |

And the Clojure code I used to setup the lambda was (no Clojure knowledge is needed for the rest of this post):

```clojure
(ns lambda
  (:gen-class
   :implements [com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.RequestStreamHandler]))

(defn -handleRequest [_ is os context]
  (let [input (slurp is)]
    (println "input:" input)
    ; If the word "error" is found anywhere in the input
    (when (re-find #"error" input)
      (throw (Exception. "test")))
    ; If the word "invalid" is found anywhere in the input
    (let [output (if (re-find #"invalid" input)
                   "{"   ; output invalid JSON
                   "{}") ; output valid JSON
      (spit os output))))
```

(See my [last post](https://juxt.pro/blog/plain-clojure-lambda) for how I set
the project up)

Please note that the input is **not** parsed, so any errors that say something
about "parsing input" come from AWS not this code. Also note that the output
(valid or invalid) does not conform to any of the formats required below (e.g.
it does not contain a `statusCode` field), this tests how each option behaves
when this is the case.

Most services have multiple ways of configuring them, the methods I'm covering
are:

- [Plain Function URLs](#plain-function-urls)
- [Function URLs + CloudFront](#function-urls--cloudfront)
- [ALB](#alb)
- [API Gateway w/ HTTP API](#api-gateway-w-http-api)
- [API Gateway w/ REST API](#api-gateway-w-rest-api)
- [API Gateway w/ REST API & Lambda Proxy Integration](#api-gateway-w-rest-api--lambda-proxy-integration)

## Which should you choose?

Before we start, this article doesn't aim to judge which option of these fits
your requirements. But if you want to know which to check out first I would
suggest:

- If you want just a URL with one lambda on the other end:
  - If you don't want a custom domain: [Plain Function URLs](#plain-function-urls)
  - If you _do_ want a custom domain: [Function URLs + CloudFront](#function-urls--cloudfront)
- Otherwise try: [ALBs](#alb) or [API Gateway w/ REST & Lambda Proxy Integration](#api-gateway-w-rest-api--lambda-proxy-integration)

## Plain Function URLs

This is by far the easiest option to setup: [just enable it, set two
settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/urls-configuration.html#create-url-console)
and you're done!

The (small) downside is that you get a randomly generated url of the form:
`https://<url-id>.lambda-url.<region>.on.aws`, but for many use cases this is
just fine.

As with most of these options, the [request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/urls-invocation.html#urls-request-payload)
and [response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/urls-invocation.html#urls-response-payload)
formats are in JSON.

Here are the results of my tests:

| Test                  | Status Code | Response Body           | `input` in lambda          |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Valid JSON request    | `200`       | `{}`                    | The JSON formatted request |
| Invalid JSON request  | `200`       | `{}`                    | The JSON formatted request |
| Invalid JSON response | `200`       | `{`                     | The JSON formatted request |
| Exception thrown      | `502`       | `Internal Server Error` | The JSON formatted request |

Surprisingly whenever the response **does not** match this format (including
being invalid JSON) a `200` response is assumed! That said it's unlikely to run
into this in practice, how often do you hand craft your response after all?
Just be wary if you are.

## Function URLs + CloudFront

This option allows you to create a [TLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain)
that points at your Lambda Function URL. The behaviour mostly identical to
Function URLs but I have included it because of one _gotcha_ in the setup that
can change the behaviour.

The setup is:

- [Create a Function URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/urls-configuration.html#create-url-console)
  (same as above)
- [Create your CloudFront Distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-creating-console.html)
  - For **origin domain** choose your **Function URL**
  - For **Allowed HTTP methods** choose all the methods you plan to use (this is the _gotcha_ I mentioned)
- If you want a custom domain, [add an A record to Route53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html)
  - Use an alias to point to your Distribution's URL
  - Make sure to setup [**Alternative domain names**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCNAME) in the distribution
- Wait until the CloudFront Distribution has finished deploying

As mentioned, this option uses Function URLs under the hood so the [request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/urls-invocation.html#urls-request-payload)
and [response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/urls-invocation.html#urls-response-payload)
formats are the same as above.

Because we have our additional _gotcha_, I've added an additional test for when
the `POST` method is disabled in CloudFront. For this test I used the same
command as in "Valid JSON request":

| Test                  | Status Code | Response Body             | `input` in lambda          |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Valid JSON request    | `200`       | `{}`                      | The JSON formatted request |
| Invalid JSON request  | `200`       | `{}`                      | The JSON formatted request |
| Invalid JSON response | `200`       | `{`                       | The JSON formatted request |
| Exception thrown      | `502`       | `Internal Server Error`   | The JSON formatted request |
| POST Method disabled  | `403`       | HTML explaining the error | Nothing                    |

This last test result was very confusing to me initially because I missed the
**Allowed HTTP methods** option initially. Once setup correctly though I had no
issues, so this is only a problem during initial setup.

## ALB

Creating an **Internet-facing** ALB with a Target Group pointing at a Lambda
is [simple enough](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-application-load-balancer.html).
As ever when configuring ALBs be cautious when configuring Security Groups,
during testing my requests were timing out until I resolved some things I had
misconfigured.

The [request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/lambda-functions.html#receive-event-from-load-balancer)
and [response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/lambda-functions.html#respond-to-load-balancer)
formats are similar but slightly different to the Function URL formats. The
major difference is in behaviour, ALBs are more _strict_ with the response
format.

Because of this strictness I wanted to test the case where the response
**format** is valid too. I modified the lambda code like so:

```diff
  (let [output (if (re-find #"invalid" input)
                 "{"   ; output invalid JSON
-                "{}") ; output valid JSON
+                (if (re-find #"valid" input)
+                  ; 👇 Added an option to return JSON in the format that the ALB wants
+                  "{\"isBase64Encoded\":false,\"statusCode\":200}"
+                  "{}")) ; output valid JSON
    (spit os output))))
```

I added an additional test using the command: `curl -v -XPOST --data '{}' --header 'Test: valid' <url under test>`

| Test                  | Status Code | Response Body            | `input` in lambda          |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Valid JSON request    | `502`       | HTML for 502 Bad Gateway | The JSON formatted request |
| Invalid JSON request  | `502`       | HTML for 502 Bad Gateway | The JSON formatted request |
| Invalid JSON response | `502`       | HTML for 502 Bad Gateway | The JSON formatted request |
| Exception thrown      | `502`       | HTML for 502 Bad Gateway | The JSON formatted request |
| Valid response format | `200`       | (an empty body)          | The JSON formatted request |

As mentioned the response format is very strict, failing to use it means an
obscure `502 Bad Gateway` error. Make sure to catch exceptions and always
return the response in the correct format.

## API Gateway w/ HTTP API

Using API Gateway presents a few options, but using HTTP APIs is the simplest
option:

- [Create your HTTP API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop.html)
  - For **Integrations** select **lambda**
  - For **Lambda function** choose your lambda
- See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-regional-api-custom-domain-create.html) for setting up a custom domain

The [request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html#http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.proxy-format-structure)
and [response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html#http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.v2)
formats seem to be identical to Function URLs. Also similarly to Function URLs
it's worth noting that responses that don't match this format are assumed to be
a `200` response.

Here are my test results:

| Test                  | Status Code | Response Body                         | `input` in lambda          |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Valid JSON request    | `200`       | `{}`                                  | The JSON formatted request |
| Invalid JSON request  | `200`       | `{}`                                  | The JSON formatted request |
| Invalid JSON response | `500`       | `{"message":"Internal Server Error"}` | The JSON formatted request |
| Exception thrown      | `500`       | `{"message":"Internal Server Error"}` | The JSON formatted request |

As mentioned these results are similar to Function URLs, to save you scrolling
up the two main differences are: "Invalid JSON response" now returns a `500`
instead of a `200`; and the body of `500` responses are now JSON.

## API Gateway w/ REST API

Setting up a REST API is a tiny bit more involved:

- [Create your API REST API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started-rest-new-console.html#getting-started-rest-new-console-create-api)
  - Choose **New API** instead of **Example API**
- [Create your Lambda Integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started-rest-new-console.html#getting-started-rest-new-console-create-integration)
  - Keep **Lambda Proxy Integration** turned off (that's the next section)
- See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-regional-api-custom-domain-create.html) for setting up a custom domain

The request and response formats are a bit more fuzzily documented due to
requests being configured using [Integration Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/integration-request-basic-setup.html)
and responses being configured using [Integration Responses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-integration-settings-integration-response.html).
Meaning you can [transform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-method-settings-execution-console.html)
the request and response in a variety of ways.

These transformations can affect the results of the tests but I still found it
useful to understand the default behaviours and to know what to configure. By
default the body is passed through to the lambda directly and I've left things
as the default for the tests. I would suggest re-running these tests (and
others!) after making configuration changes to see how these behaviours have
really changed:

To test this setup I had to tweak two of the commands (the lambda code was kept
the same):
| Test | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Invalid JSON response | `curl -v -XPOST --data '"invalid"' <url under test>` |
| Exception thrown | `curl -v -XPOST --data '"error"'   <url under test>` |

And now for the tests:

| Test                  | Status Code | Response Body                                                                                                                                                                                               | `input` in lambda            |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Valid JSON request    | `200`       | `{}`                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `{}` (the input body)        |
| Invalid JSON request  | `400`       | A JSON object with a `message` field explaining parse error                                                                                                                                                 | Nothing                      |
| Invalid JSON response | `200`       | `{`                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `"invalid"` (the input body) |
| Exception thrown      | `200`       | A JSON object in [this format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/handle-errors-in-lambda-integration.html#handle-standard-errors-in-lambda-integration) showing the error thrown | `"error"` (the input)        |

A couple things to note here:

1. If the request is not valid JSON, your function won't be called.
   I was not able to find a way around this in my testing, please let me know if I missed something.
2. Throwing an error gets you a `200` by default.
   The official way to handle this is to configure the **Lambda error regex**
   which is matched against the _errorMessage_ property in the response (as
   noted [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-method-settings-execution-console.html)
   in the final _Note_ box, search for _errorMessage_). Luckily exceptions are
   already formatted this way, but note that you can also return JSON in this
   format if you like.

## API Gateway w/ REST API & Lambda Proxy Integration

The setup is nearly identical to the above:

- [Create your API REST API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started-rest-new-console.html#getting-started-rest-new-console-create-api)
  - Choose **New API** instead of **Example API**
- [Create your Lambda Integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started-rest-new-console.html#getting-started-rest-new-console-create-integration)
  - This time turn **Lambda Proxy Integration** on
- See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-regional-api-custom-domain-create.html) for setting up a custom domain

The [request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html#api-gateway-simple-proxy-for-lambda-input-format)
and [response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html#api-gateway-simple-proxy-for-lambda-output-format)
formats are similar to the Function URL formats but with enough small
differences that it's worth you taking a look at them.

And here are my test results (using the original commands):
| Test | Status Code | Response Body | `input` in lambda |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Valid JSON request | `200` | (an empty body) | The JSON formatted request |
| Invalid JSON request | `200` | (an empty body) | The JSON formatted request |
| Invalid JSON response | `502` | `{"message": "Internal server error"}` | The JSON formatted request |
| Exception thrown | `502` | `{"message": "Internal server error"}` | The JSON formatted request |

The results here are very similar to using API Gateway w/ HTTP API, the main
difference being that if you don't conform to the output format (i.e. you have
valid JSON but an invalid format) it _doesn't_ fill the body of the request
with your original response.

## Conclusion

There are many different options for calling an AWS Lambda via HTTP, and while
it's fairly obvious that each of them would have different setup instructions I
found that the variance in their behaviours was enough to trip me up many
times. Hopefully the above information will be useful to avoid the gotchas in
your chosen option the next time either of us wants to call a Lambda over HTTP.
