At the [XT25 Fintech Conference](https://www.juxt.pro/xt25/), Rob Moffat, Senior Technical Architect at [FINOS](https://www.finos.org/), explored a refreshing perspective on building software: treat all work as risk management.

In his talk, 'Risk-First Software Development', Rob drew on concepts like the Lindy Effect, the idea that the longer a technology has survived, the longer it is likely to keep going, and applied them to engineering decision-making. He challenged attendees to see software development not just as delivering features, but as a continuous process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks.

From the trade-offs of adding unit tests to the pitfalls of overly complex codebases, Rob highlighted how each decision impacts the balance between speed, safety, and sustainability.

His central message:

**The basic problem of software development is risk.**

With a mix of humour, references to pop culture, and practical frameworks from [riskfirst.org](https://riskfirst.org), Rob left the audience with a powerful reminder: whether it is adopting AI or shipping your next release, success depends on managing uncertainty as deliberately as you manage your roadmap.
