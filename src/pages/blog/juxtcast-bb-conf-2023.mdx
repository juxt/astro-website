In this JUXT Cast episode, I am joined by Malcolm Sparks (CTO), Alex Davis (Lead Engineer), and Harry Percival (Senior Software Engineer) to discuss the memorable JUXT 10-Year Anniversary party at Wilton's Music Hall in London, the [Babashka Conf 2023](https://babashka.org/conf/) in Berlin (where Malcolm was a keynote speaker), the London to Brighton Cycle Ride, the latest XTDB update, and Post-Agile.

The episode ends with 'ParcLife', one of the songs performed live at JUXT anniversary party by Malcolm Sparks, Alex Davis, and Jeremy Taylor.
