Your backlog isn't just a list of tasks: it's a list of risks you're choosing to address. Could this reframing change how you think about trade-offs & priorities? Do your engineers know which specific risks your development methodology is designed to mitigate, and how?

JUXT CTO Henry Garner speaks with Rob Moffat, Chief Architect at [FINOS (Fintech Open Source Foundation)](https://www.finos.org/) and author of [Risk First Software Development](https://pragprog.com/titles/rmrfsd/risk-first-software-development-second-edition/). Rob adopted this lens while working in investment banking, noticing that his approach didn't quite match Agile orthodoxy. The common thread was risk management, even when nobody called it that.

The conversation moves through the hidden risks that catch microservices adopters off guard, how you can easily bridge the worlds of technology and finance when you speak the language of risk, and why FINOS projects from AI governance to the Common Domain Model keep converging on risk frameworks as their natural structure. On AI, Rob talks about human-in-the-loop from a distinctive angle: intelligence, reliability and thousands of years of proven human resilience.

The discussion also explores the cultural challenge of promoting open source in guarded institutions, the tension between developer maker culture and the new reality of supervising AI workers, and predictions for 2026.
