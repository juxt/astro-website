In October 2023, Nathan Marz announced the Clojure API to Rama, a new programming platform for building distributed applications that was released last August.

Red Planet Labs revealed Rama for the first time by building and operating a Twitter-scale Mastodon instance that’s 100x less code than Twitter wrote to build the equivalent.

In this episode, we delve into some of the conceptual foundations of Rama, the influence the Clojure language has had on its design and discuss some of the many difficult problems Nathan and his team have had to solve in the course of developing Rama.

For more information about Rama and it's Clojure API, you can read this post on Red Planet Labs blog: Introducing Rama’s Clojure API: [build end-to-end scalable backends in 100x less code](https://blog.redplanetlabs.com/2023/10/11/introducing-ramas-clojure-api/).
