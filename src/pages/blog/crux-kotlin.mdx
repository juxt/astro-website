I recently had the opportunity to participate in a XTDB workshop run by
Jeremy Taylor. This opened my eyes to the power and flexibility of XTDB.

A database that allows you to query not only forward and backward in
time, but orthogonally constrained on when data was known? That's
awesome! If Nixon had used XTDB, then Howard Baker's [famous
question](https://youtu.be/LnaEUCSFk38) would have been trivial.

As a Kotlin engineer with my Clojure knowledge in its infancy, I set out
to see how I would use XTDB within a purely Kotlin context. The Java API
gave me great place to start, so I cloned the repo and began my journey
of discovery. My goal was to create an idiomatic way for Kotlin devs to
interact with XTDB which requires zero knowledge of Clojure
datastructures.

To get started, we need to learn a bit about Kotlin's extension
functions. Once we have that foundation, we'll take a deep dive into
creating XTDB DSLs with Kotlin.

# Kotlin Extensions

One of my favourite features of Kotlin is the ability to add functions
to classes and interfaces without the requirement to wrap them in an
additional class.

For example, let's say we have a Java class from a third party that we
can't modify:

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private String lastName;

    public Person(String name, String lastName) {
        this.name = name;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public String getLastName() {
        return lastName;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void setLastName(String lastName) {
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
}
```

We might want to have a convenient function to get the full name of the
person. This can be implemented in the following ways:

```kotlin
fun Person.getFullName(): String {
    return "$name $lastName"
}

// Alternatively
fun Person.getFullName() = "$name $lastName"

// Or even
val Person.fullName get() = "$name $lastName"

// Usage
val me = Person("Alistair", "O'Neill")
println(me.getFullName())

// Or
println(me.fullName)
```

In Kotlin, we can use `.name` and `.lastName` rather than calling
`.getName()` and `.getLastName()`. When interacting with Java classes,
any fields which have a getter and setter can be used directly as if
they are `var` (mutable reference). Any field with just a getter is
treated as a `val` (immutable reference).

Indeed, the name of the underlying field is irrelevant. The Java
getter/setter could look like the following, and our Kotlin would be the
same:

```java
public class Person {
    private String foo;

    // ... constructor elided ...

    public String getName() {
        return foo;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.foo = name;
    }

    // ... other accessor methods elided ...
}
```

Why is this useful, though? This allows us to add Kotlin functions to
the Java API in xtdb-core without requiring any Kotlin code whatsoever
in `xtdb-core`! All Kotlin code can live in a separate module entirely.

# Idiomatic DSLs with Kotlin

In [kotlin-dsl](https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/tree/main/labs/kotlin-dsl)
we have implemented extensions to `IXtdbSubmitClient` and
`IXtdbDataSource` that allow us to write queries and transactions
directly.

For example, to find people with the same forename and surname, a query
looks like this:

```kotlin
// Set up
val node = XtdbKt.startNode { }
val person = "person".sym
val name = "name".sym
val forenameKey = "forename".kw
val surnameKey = "surname".kw

node.db().q {
    find {
        +person
        +name
    }

    where {
        person has forenameKey eq name
        person has surnameKey eq name
    }
}
```

This looks nice, but what is actually going on here?

`IXtdbDataSource.q` is an extension function which takes any number of
parameters and, finally, an argument of type `QueryContext.() -> Unit`.
The type `QueryContext.() -> Unit` is a function which has
`QueryContext` as a Receiver, doesn't take arguments, and doesn't return
anything.

When we say \"Receiver\" we mean that, within the function, a reference
to `this` refers to an instance of `QueryContext`. Our scope has become
`QueryContext`. Most of our DSL will operate within this scope, giving
us a sandbox to build up queries using a syntax that's easy on the eyes.

The sections ahead will explain our use of trailing lambdas (sometimes
called \"lambda block syntax\" in other languages), scoped extensions,
operator overloading, infix functions, and a bit of invocation mojo.
Finally, we'll tie it all together to create an even more powerful DSL
around [XTDB Query
Rules](https://xtdb.com/reference/queries.html#rules).

## 1. Using Lambdas

In Kotlin, when calling a function where the last argument you supply is
a lambda (denoted by curly braces), you are allowed to move the lambda
outside the function call's parentheses.

Thus, the above could equivalently have been called as follows (although
your IDE will yell at you):

```kotlin
node.db().queryKt({
    find {
        +person
        +name
    }

    where {
        person has forenameKey eq name
        person has surnameKey eq name
    }
})

// Moved outside of the parentheses
node.db().queryKt() {
    find {
        +person
        +name
    }

    where {
        person has forenameKey eq name
        person has surnameKey eq name
    }
}
```

In fact, because our `IXtdbDatasource.q` can only take a single function
argument (if you provide no parameters for the query), we can omit the
`()` entirely from the function call to leave us with the original
syntax. This results in more human-readable queries.

So, within our curly braces, we are acting within the scope of an
instance of `QueryContext`. This is why we are able to call functions
like `find` which are defined in the
[QueryContext](https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/blob/main/labs/kotlin-dsl/src/main/kotlin/xtdb/api/query/context/QueryContext.kt)
class.

## 2. Extensions with Scopes

Next, let's look at this curious usage of `+person`. As I've already
mentioned, Kotlin allows you to add extension functions to extant types.
For most purposes, this is done at the top level so that your extension
is available everywhere. For example:

```kotlin
val String.sym: Symbol get() = Symbol.intern(this)
```

After adding this extension method, anywhere I want to create a symbol
from a string, it is as convenient as `"foo".sym`.

However, extensions don't need to be created at a global level. They can
be declared within a class to restrict their usage to within the scope
of that class. Returning to the Person example from earlier, we could
have the following:

```kotlin
class Family(val father: Person, val mother: Person, val child: Person) { //
    val Person.fullName get() = "$name $lastName"
}

fun main() {
    val father = Person("Dan", "O'Neill")
    val mother = Person("Joanne", "O'Neill")
    val me = Person("Alistair", "O'Neill")

    val family = Family(father, mother, me)

    // This won't compile. Person.fullName is not defined in this scope.
    println(father.fullName)

    // This works because in the apply block, we have the scope of Family.
    family.apply {
        println(father.fullName)
    }
}
```

- This is the Person class defined above in Java

So, how is this utilised in our Query syntax?

In
[FindContext](https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/blob/main/labs/kotlin-dsl/src/main/kotlin/xtdb/api/query/context/FindContext.kt),
we define

```kotlin
operator fun FindClause.unaryPlus() = add(this)

operator fun Symbol.unaryPlus() = +FindClause.SimpleFind(this)
```

We have added the extension function `unaryPlus` to the `Symbol` class
within the scope of `FindBuilder`.

By restricting our extension of `Symbol` to within the scope of our
BuilderContext, it means that the body of the extension can interact
with (and mutate!) the instance of BuilderContext. Furthermore, it
avoids conflicts where we might wish to have `+person` mean something
else in another context.

## 3. Operator Functions

`unaryPlus` is a special type of function known as an `operator`
function. In practice, this means that it is called using special
syntax.

Operator functions are usually used to define things like what `a + b`
means. Let's have a look at a simple example.

```kotlin
data class Fraction(val n: Int, val d: Int) {
    override fun toString() = "$n/$d"
}

fun main() {
    val a = Fraction(1, 3)
    val b = Fraction(1, 2)
    println(a + b)
}
```

This won't compile because our compiler doesn't know what it means to
add two Fraction classes together. We can define this using the operator
function `plus`. (I don't account for simplifying fractions, but that
isn't important for the example.)

```kotlin
data class Fraction(val n: Int, val d: Int) {
    override fun toString() = "$n/$d"
    operator fun plus(other: Fraction) = Fraction(n * other.d + other.n * d, d * other.d)
}

// Or we could do it as an extension
data class Fraction(val n: Int, val d: Int) {
    override fun toString() = "$n/$d"
}

operator fun Fraction.plus(other: Fraction) = Fraction(n * other.d + other.n * d, d * other.d)
```

Both of these implementations convert `a + b` to `a.plus(b)` with our
supplied definitions. The difference is that the first requires us to
change the Fraction class, whereas the latter is as an extension so can
be added elsewhere (or in a given special scope).

In the XTDB query example, we have `+person` where `person` is an
instance of `Symbol`. This line will call `person.unaryPlus()` which is
defined in the scope of `FindContext` to add a `SimpleFind` clause to
our list for the Find section of the query.

## 4. Infix Functions

One of the benefits of having a DSL is to allow complicated function
calls or data structures to read more naturally.

Let's take the example of adding a restriction to the `where` section of
a query to check whether a person document has the key `:name`. Using
normal Kotlin functions, this might look like:

```kotlin
fun hasKey(symbol: Symbol, key: Keyword) = TODO("Add to your list of clauses or w/e")

// Used like:
db.q {
    where {
        hasKey(person, name)
    }
}

// Or we could define it as an extension function
fun Symbol.hasKey(key: Keyword) = TODO("Do the thing")

// Used like:
db.q {
    where {
        person.hasKey(name)
    }
}
```

While the latter is certainly nicer than the former, it still doesn't
give us the \"plain English\" feel of a fluid interface. We can do
better by using an `infix` operation. Even if you have never
specifically heard of infix operations, much less implemented one
yourself, you have almost certainly used one.

```kotlin
val me = mapOf(
    "name" to "Alistair",
    "age" to 26,
    "National Insurance" to "lol, fat chance"
)
```

If we look at the signature of `mapOf`, we find:

```kotlin
public fun <K, V> mapOf(vararg pairs: Pair<K, V>): Map<K, V>
```

That's a little odd. When we were creating our map, we never explicitly
created `Pair` objects. Come to think of it, the way we just have `to`
between two values is rather strange.

Fortunately, Kotlin is Open Source, so we can press Ctrl-B on it and
have a look at the definition to see what's going on:

```kotlin
public infix fun <A, B> A.to(that: B): Pair<A, B> = Pair(this, that)
```

This is a function that acts \"on\" an object of type A with a single
argument of type B. These are used as the `first` and `second` values of
the returned `Pair`.

The `infix` modifier is what allows us to call the function without
needing a dot or parentheses. Note that you can call an infix function
the \"normal\" way if you really want to:

```kotlin
// Using the infix
"Alistair" to "O'Neill"

// Calling normally
"Alistair".to("O'Neill")
```

There are some restrictions on what can be made an infix function and
what can't:

- The function must take exactly one argument which cannot be a
  `vararg`, nor can it have a default value.

- The function must be a member of a class, or an extension function
  (i.e. it must have a Receiver).

With this in mind, let's consider how to implement syntax that modifies
our `WhereContext` and uses more human looking syntax:

```kotlin
// Desired syntax:
where {
    person has name
}

// The definition within the WhereContext class
infix fun Symbol.has(key: Keyword) = TODO("Mutate our context accordingly")
```

Happy days! We can now use `has` in between a `Symbol` and `Keyword` to
do ...something. In our case, we might want to add a newly constructed
clause to a list.

Things start to get a little hairy when we want to chain together infix
functions. We not only want to be able to say that `person` has a `name`
key, but also want to be able to constrain what the value of this key
is.

```kotlin
// Desired syntax:
where {
    person has name               // Checks for the existence of a name key
    person has name eq "Alistair" // Checks that the person has a name key with value "Alistair"
}
```

When infix functions are chained in such a way, the order of operations
is from left to right. That is to say, the above code is equivalent to:

```kotlin
where {
    (person has name) eq "Alistair"
}
```

If we want our DSL to look like this in practice, it means that our `eq`
function will need to be defined on whatever the result type of the
`has` function is.

Having `has` spit out a bespoke data class which is then extended with
the `eq` function would be absolutely fine if we only wanted to support
the five word statement. We would just have the code that mutates the
Context act in the `eq` function.

However, we want both of them to be valid. This means that we still need
to mutate the Context as a side effect of `has` in case there isn't an
`eq` function being called. In the case that there is an `eq` call, we
don't want to add two clauses to our `where` section. In this specific
instance, it would be fine to add both query results-wise as they are
overlapping restrictions: a document can't have a key with a specific
value if it doesn't have that key at all!

I'm not happy with that, however. It would result in a `Query` object
that doesn't strictly represent what a user has input, and that's just
bad design (and probably has performance implications for the query
engine). Instead, I implemented a buffer system where the most recent
clause isn't added to the list for the section until either build time,
or a new clause is started.

In the case that the `eq` form of the statement is used, it replaces the
buffered `HasKey` clause with a `HasKeyEqualTo` clause:

```kotlin
// Within WhereContext
data class SymbolAndKey(val symbol: Symbol, val key: Keyword)

infix fun Symbol.has(key: Keyword) =
    SymbolAndKey(this, key).also {
        add(HasKey(this, key))
    }

infix fun SymbolAndKey.eq(value: Any) = replace(HasKeyEqualTo(symbol, key, value))


// The abstract class which sets up the buffer
abstract class ComplexBuilderContext<CLAUSE, TYPE>(
    private val constructor: (List<CLAUSE>) -> TYPE
): BuilderContext<TYPE> {
    private val clauses = mutableListOf<CLAUSE>()
    private var hangingClause: CLAUSE? = null

    protected fun add(clause: CLAUSE) {
        lockIn()
        hangingClause = clause
    }

    protected fun replace(clause: CLAUSE) {
        hangingClause = clause
    }

    private fun lockIn() {
        hangingClause?.run(clauses::add)
        hangingClause = null
    }

    override fun build(): TYPE {
        lockIn()
        return constructor(clauses)
    }
}
```

## 5. Invoking Mojo

What does the following do?

```kotlin
"hello"("world")
```

If your answer is \"That's a `String`, not a function. What do you think
you are playing at?\", you have a valid point. As it stands, it is
meaningless and won't compile.

What if we **could** call a String as a function, though? In terms of
natural looking, declarative input, it opens up a lovely design space.
Well, this is Kotlin, and we can extend types as we please: including
adding an `invoke` function.

```kotlin
operator fun String.invoke(other: String) {
    println("$this $other")
}
```

By adding the `invoke` operator function, we can now use a `String` as
if it is a function which takes another `String`.

This functionality, in conjunction with the fact that trailing lambdas
can be lifted out of parenthesis enables our nested `XtdbKt`
configuration to look especially pleasing:

```kotlin
XtdbKt.startNode {
    "xtdb/tx-log" {
        "kv-store" {
            module = "xtdb.rocksdb/->kv-store"
            "db-dir" to File("/tx")
        }
    }
    "xtdb/document-store" {
        "kv-store" {
            module = "xtdb.rocksdb/->kv-store"
            "db-dir" to File("/doc")
        }
    }
    "xtdb/index-store" {
        "kv-store" {
            module = "xtdb.rocksdb/->kv-store"
            "db-dir" to File("/index")
        }
    }
}
```

> Code is data, data code, --- that is all
>
> Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know

--- Keats (probably)

This is achieved by adding the following `invoke` extension function to
String within the `NodeConfigurationContext` and
`ModuleConfigurationContext`:

```kotlin
operator fun String.invoke(block: ModuleConfigurationContext.() -> Unit) {
    builder.with(this, build(block))
}
```

It's amazing how a few little concepts can be combined to create
convenient bespoke syntax.

## 6. Tying it all together

We now have all the pieces in place. As a final example --- and perhaps
my favourite example of creating one's own syntax --- this is how you
define [XTDB Query Rules](https://xtdb.com/reference/queries.html#rules)
and use them from `kotlin-dsl`:

```kotlin
// Setup
val node = XtdbKt.startNode()
val db = node.db()

val dwarf = "dwarf".sym
val descendentOf = "descendentOf".sym
val descendent = "descendent".sym
val ancestor = "ancestor".sym
val fatherKey = "father".kw
val intermediate = "intermediate".sym

db.q {
    find {
        +dwarf
    }

    where {
        rule(descendentOf) (dwarf, "farin")
    }

    rules {
        def(descendentOf) (descendent, ancestor) {
            descendent has fatherKey eq ancestor
        }

        def(descendentOf) (descendent, ancestor) {
            descendent has fatherKey eq intermediate
            rule(descendentOf) (intermediate, ancestor)
        }
    }
}
```

Here, we are declaring a Rule `descendentOf` that accepts two parameters
and then providing the restrictions on those parameters using a
`WhereContext.()->Unit`

Being able to split out the parameters from the name of the Rule comes
from the fact that the definition is created in two function calls.

```kotlin
data class RuleDeclaration(val name: Symbol)

fun def(name: Symbol) = RuleDeclaration(name)

operator fun RuleDeclaration.invoke(vararg params: Symbol, block: WhereContext.() -> Unit) =
    +RuleDefinition(
        name,
        params.toList(),
        WhereContext.build(block)
    )
```

The first call of `def` takes the `name` of the Rule and creates a
`RuleDeclaration`. This `declaration` then gets invoked with a variable
number of parameters (which are in the parentheses) and a lambda.
Because the lambda is the final argument, it is written outside the
parentheses in curly braces.

All of this comes together to form a very natural looking way of
defining a Rule.

# Conclusion

Overall, I am incredibly excited to see where we can take `kotlin-dsl`.

Our goal is to provide a seamless, strongly-typed utility layer which
can lie on top of such a powerful and versatile database.

Stay tuned!
