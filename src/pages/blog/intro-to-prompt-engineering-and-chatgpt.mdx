New tools like ChatGPT can revolutionise the way that we work. They can be our partner through problem solving, they can be our personal tutor  or they can automate boring tasks giving us the time to focus on what's interesting and what's next.

In this presentation, I'll take you on a deep dive into the fascinating world of ChatGPT and 'Prompt Engineering'. I'll help you understand how ChatGPT works, its strengths and weaknesses, and how we can optimise its performance using specific Prompt Engineering techniques. 

We'll explore basic concepts such as your prompt checklist and gradually move to advanced applications involving DALL-E and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). We'll end with a fun and effective approach of using this powerful AI tool as your personal tutor. If you want to fully take advantage of ChatGPT, this presentation will show you how. Hopefully by the end, you'll want to take ChatGPT along with you as your problem solving partner too. Let's help you get your ChatGPT experiences from good to great!

# 🚨 UPDATE ALERT 🚨

Just when we thought our exploration couldn't get any more thrilling, OpenAI rolled out a slew of enhancements to ChatGPT, mere hours before our video hit the web.
Check out the full details on their <a href="https://devday.openai.com/" target="_blank">Developer Day page</a>, but here’s the scoop on what’s new and noteworthy:


## Introducing GPT-4-Turbo
Right off the heels of our presentation, say hello to **GPT-4-Turbo** — now accessible via the API as `gpt-4-1106-preview`.
It's as if the AI read my wish list!
A faster and cheaper GPT-4 model that boasts a new 120k token context window, the largest for any (chat) GPT at the moment.
ChatGPT will remember longer conversations and read longer documents.


## GPTs - Your Personalized AI Marketplace
The future is customization, and with **GPTs Marketplace**, you can craft your own customised GPT agents directly through the ChatGPT interface.
These agents can be shared or sold kept for your eyes only.
An exciting world of custom agents is about to appear.


## Assistants API - Craft Your Unique GPT Assistant

Create bespoke AI companion with the new **Assistants API**.
By introducing a 'Threads' feature, OpenAI have eliminated the need to resend chat histories for every interaction and your agents can take advantage of all the power of ChatGPT easier than ever.


## Multimodal ChatGPT - The All-in-One AI Experience

Soon, you'll be able to prompt DALL-E to modify images, surf the web, and engage in text-based conversations all in one go—no more switching between modes.
The AI adapts to the task at hand.

The AI landscape is rapidly evolving, and it's a thrill to navigate through these advancements together.
Stay tuned, and let's harness these updates to elevate our ChatGPT experiences from great to extraordinary!
