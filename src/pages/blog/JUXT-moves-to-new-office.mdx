We recently posted on LinkedIn
[\"Growing\"](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6420928485006675968).

JUXT has from inception had a strong presence in
[London](https://juxt.pro/london.html) and continues to work with some
high profile names in the City.

Our continuing expansion has now seen us outgrow our original London
Office and we have recently moved to a new location.

The move has been brought about by our need to increase the size of our
team to work on projects that we are running with a major
telecommunications company and our Tier 1 Investments Bank customers.

With further exciting projects in the pipeline we envisage further
expansion in both the London Office and our Headquarters in Milton
Keynes.

Our developers are busy delivering international projects, and we are
also developing new innovative open source products that will compliment
and enhance our offering to both our existing and new customers. We hope
to have two of these solutions at MVP by early Autumn.
