_\'JavaScript is falling down\'_. This is the Ukuele tune that [Kris
Jenkins](https://github.com/krisajenkins) serenades us with at XT16.
JavaScript was great for websites of old, but it is becoming
increasingly inadequate for the current generation of thick client apps
that we are building today.

Kris states that there's a new wave of languages here to give us hope.
These languages bring us better architectures and fresh ways of
thinking; that we have an optimistic future ahead of us.

I really enjoyed Kris's talk; in particular a live Elm coding demo where
he highlights how joyful it can be to have a simple yet elegant type
system on hand to deliver great validation of code and data as well as
error messages.
