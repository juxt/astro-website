In a digital world where languages and technologies evolve at breakneck speed, it's crucial to understand the foundations that continue to influence our tech choices. This presentation not only reveals how Clojure is deeply rooted in Common Lisp but also explores the grand vision of the JVM as a universal computing platform. It paints a vivid picture of how the tech landscape has transformed since the late '90s, offering a compelling comparison between then and now. Additionally, it dives into the efficiency and performance disparities between Common Lisp and Clojure, providing valuable insights for developers navigating the complex realm of programming languages.

Now, let's consider something we all hold dear – our planet and the technology we use. By embracing Common Lisp over Clojure and the JVM, we're not only choosing a powerful programming language but also making a greener choice for the environment. In a world where sustainability matters more than ever, our programming decisions can play a significant role. Join us in uncovering the enduring legacy of Common Lisp and its relevance in the ever-evolving modern tech world while making a conscious choice for a greener future.
