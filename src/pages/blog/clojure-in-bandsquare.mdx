# Managing a Fanbase

[BandSquare](https://www.bandsquare.com/) is a general purpose marketing
platform helping artists and big organizations to manage and extract
data from their audiences and fanbases. The platform uses campaigns,
social network data, smaller tailored websites and polls to provide a
audience platform that can pull and push data. An example use case is
fanbases requesting that artists visit certain cities.

Once data has been collected it is then amalgamated to provide a unified
view of an audience.

BandSquare has Clojure and [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com/) at the
heart of the system. I caught up with [Val
Waeselynck](https://twitter.com/val_waeselynck) to find out more.

# Technology Story

_Jon:_ What is the tech story here?

_Val:_ We used to be an Angular.js SPA (Single Page Application) backed
by Node.js and MongoDb.

As the information model evolved and became more sophisticated, the
complexity grew. MongoDB in particular became a big pain point as the
querying power is very limited. We had lots of bugs and troubles
evolving the platform.

We wanted it to be a data platform and we were stuck. We wanted
features, to go faster, and to have better quality. We could not add man
power so we needed a technical shift to change the dynamics.

_Jon:_ How did the Clojure journey begin?

_Val:_ At the time I knew Clojure. I had very little experience with
Datomic; I'd played with it a bit.

The value proposition of Clojure is a good fit. I could use the
interactive development story of the REPL to raise productivity and
quality. Datomic was a good fit too that didn't have the problems of
classic databases.

Datomic is very good for querying for data in a very expressive way.
It's also great for testing; we wanted a really good testing story to
increase quality. We were migrating the whole back-end from Node.js and
we wanted to test that everything still worked.

_Jon:_ Any regrets?

_Val:_ No. The migration to Clojure/Datomic made us so much more
productive and we have less bugs.

Mongo/Angular is not bad tech, just a not good fit for the level of
sophistication we needed. We still use Angular on the front end.

_Jon:_ What about using ClojureScript on the front end?

_Val:_ I wish I could - an architecture based on React.js would be good
as well - but not right now.

## Datomic

_Jon:_ Any challenges with Datomic?

_Val:_ I wouldn't advise a team to use it if they don't have the
architectural initiative to embrace a new paradigm. You have to figure
out how to architect your system to get the most leverage, but this can
be really rewarding.

For example we rely on a lot on a special feature called _speculative
writes_ (aka
[`db.with()`](http://docs.datomic.com/clojure/#datomic.api/with)) where
you can pretend that a write is made locally. This has enabled us to
have an architecture where we can rewrite code and perform testing using
this ability. We can fork databases and experiment with no runtime cost.

You can also mock and clone connections to debug locally data that is in
production; this gives amazing leverage and opportunities. This stuff is
extremely powerful, but the challenge is you have to model your
architecture to leverage it.

## Tech Stack

_Jon:_ What does your whole stack look like?

_Val:_ We use AWS, EBS. PostgreSQL, S3, Redis for caching, Google
Analytics, Datomic on DynamoDB, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
which is good for hosting SPAs.

_Jon:_ What Clojure libraries do you use?

_Val:_ I'm a big fan of
[Specter](https://github.com/nathanmarz/specter) - I don't use nearly as
much of it as I would like.

The data manipulation capabilities of Datomic are almost better than
Specter; it's also a library that has a Datalog querying engine.

We also use [DataScript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript); we store
a representation of the data model in DataScript, like an annotated UML
diagram. We derive the Datomic schema from data in DataScript.

_Jon:_ Wow, sounds like an interesting approach. What's the motivation?

_Val:_ The domain model was duplicated in code in various places: in the
Datomic schema, in the Plumatic Schema validation area, in data
transformation code (Datomic to JSON). We decided to have one source of
truth that removes the duplication; a single declarative place where the
information model is described and that different representations of the
data model can be derived from. Some people are opposed to this
approach, but it's a different philosophy.

_Jon:_ What else do you use?

[Plumatic Plumbing](https://github.com/plumatic/plumbing), especially
the [Graph
API](https://github.com/plumatic/plumbing#graph-the-functional-swiss-army-knife),
which lets you express complex computations as graphs of simple steps.
Each computational step is small and depends on previous steps in the
graph. It's very good for code reuse of the small, expressive steps.

_Jon:_ How much code do you have?

_Val:_ About 26K lines outside tests, 35K tests including. Our platform
does a lot; information extraction, talking to other services and
integrating data etc.

_Jon:_ How do you feel about the state of your current codebase?

_Val:_ The codebase is clean, it's just big because it has lots of
functionality.

One of the biggest changes we could do is to move to a GraphQL like
architecture, such as using [Om Next](https://github.com/omcljs/) or
[Falcor](http://netflix.github.io/falcor/). This would be a better way
of exchanging data and removing the accidental complexity of lots of
REST endpoints exchanging JSON in different formats.

## Paris?

_Jon:_ What's the state of Clojure adoption in Paris?

_Val:_ A few companies are using it and beyond that there are many more
people interested. You either find it in the departments of big
companies, or the big startups.

_Jon:_ Do you see it growing?

_Val:_ Definitely; more and more people are interested. CTOs are
reluctant right now to change, but the culture itself is shifting.
