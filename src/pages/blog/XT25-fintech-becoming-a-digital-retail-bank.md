At the [XT25 Fintech Conference](https://www.juxt.pro/xt25/), Alexey Gabsatarov, Chief Technology Officer at [Kroo Bank](https://kroo.com/), shared the story of Kroo’s journey to becoming one of the UK’s newest fully regulated digital banks.

In his talk, “Becoming a Digital Retail Bank: What We’ve Learned on Kroo’s Journey”, Alexey highlighted the technical, cultural, and regulatory challenges of moving from fintech startup to full-service retail bank.

He discussed key lessons from the journey, including:

- Simple, ethical banking: delivering fewer but more impactful features, with market-leading rates, zero fees abroad, and a commitment to sustainability.

- Architecture evolution: moving from a modular monolith to microservices, and eventually to event-driven and serverless approaches for scale and agility.

- Scaling infrastructure as code: developing tools and practices to standardise and automate deployment while supporting rapid growth.

- Adopting AI/ML responsibly: embedding machine learning in fraud detection, customer support, and unstructured data processing, while balancing innovation with governance and regulatory compliance.

- Building accountability and motivation: ensuring teams remain autonomous, competent, and connected, while avoiding the “unaccountability machine” that can plague large organisations.

Alexey’s talk offered a candid look at how Kroo is combining technology, culture, and ethics to reshape the customer banking experience.
