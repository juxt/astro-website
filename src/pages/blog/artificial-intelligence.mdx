Welcome to the first part of a series of articles based around
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Together, we are going to
embark on a journey surrounding the history of Artificial Intelligence
and culminating in how it is shaping the very world we live in.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the theory and development of computer
systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence,
such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and
translation between languages.

In a nutshell, it's breaking down human intelligence into exact terms so
it can be mimicked by a machine. To do this AI uses approaches from many
different fields including Mathematics, Computer Science and Psychology.

# History

The history of AI is intertwined with some of the greatest minds in
human history, involved in setting up the foundations of thought and
culture.

## Philosophy (428BC - Present)

It makes sense to begin with [Plato](http://www.iep.utm.edu/plato/), his
teacher [Socrates](http://www.iep.utm.edu/socrates/) and student
[Aristotle](http://www.iep.utm.edu/aristotl/).

> What is characteristic of piety which makes all actions pious... that
> I may have it to turn to, and to use as a standard whereby to judge
> your actions and those of other men.

This provokes an interesting examination into which characteristics and
actions make man, well, ... a man? Determining these could answer the
question of mimicking man.

## Mathematics (800 - Present)

Logic, initially introduced by Aristotle, became a Mathematical subject
due to [George
Boole](https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Boole). Algorithms
follows as the connection between logical thinking and Mathematical
problem solving. \"Algorithms is a process or set of rules to be
followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially
by a computer\".

In 1650AD French Mathematician and Philosopher [Rene
Descartes](http://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/) and [Wilhelm
Leibniz](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gottfried-Wilhelm-Leibniz)
discussed dualism and materialism. This was the concept of the mind and
soul outside nature versus logical conclusions that, in modern society,
can be carried out on mechanical devices.

Mathematics underpins AI. [Godels Incompleteness
Theorem](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/453503/can-someone-explain-g%C3%B6dels-incompleteness-theorems-in-layman-terms),
which asks whether mathematics is complete, showed that in any language
expressive enough to describe the properties of the natural numbers,
there are true statements that are undecidable; their truth cannot be
established by any algorithm.

Without [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), the
father of modern computing, no article on AI is _complete_. Godel's
idea's were picked up by Alan Turing, who wanted to characterise which
functions are computable. In 1936, the Church-Turing thesis stated that
\"the [Turing Machine](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TuringMachine.html)
can compute any computable functions\", (with no guarantees on runtime
or memory). Turing also showed that there were some functions that no
Turing machine can compute. For example, no machine can tell, in
general, whether or not a given program will return an answer on a given
input, or run forever.

The third great contribution from Mathematics to AI (after logic and
computation) is [Probability
Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory). In the 17th
and 18th Century,
[Fermat](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pierre-de-Fermat),
[Bernoulli](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jakob-Bernoulli),
[Pascal](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Blaise-Pascal),
[Laplace](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pierre-Simon-marquis-de-Laplace),
amongst others, advanced probability. They did this from from describing
the events of a gambling event, to become an integral part of
quantitative science, in dealing with uncertain measurements and
incomplete theories. [Bayes\'
rule](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/probability-ap/stats-conditional-probability/v/bayes-theorem-visualized),
and the subsequent field of Bayesian analysis, form the basis of the
modern approach to uncertain reasoning in AI systems.

## Psychology (1879 - Present)

For most of the early history of AI and [cognitive
science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science), no
significant distinction was drawn between the two fields, and it was
common to see AI programs described as psychological results without any
claim as to the exact human behavior they were modelling. In the last
decade or so, however, the methodological distinctions have become
clearer, and most work now falls into one field or the other.

## Computer Engineering (1940 - Present)

For artificial intelligence to succeed, we need two things: intelligence
and an
[artifact](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/106473/what-does-artifact-mean).
Therefore as hardware in computers have improved, the possible
capabilities for AI have improved alongside.

AI also owes a debt to the software side of computer science, which has
supplied the operating systems, programming languages, and tools needed
to write modern programs. This is one area where the debt has been
repaid. Work in AI has pioneered many ideas that have made their way
back to \"mainstream\" computer science, including time sharing,
interactive interpreters, the linked list data type and automatic
storage management. Also, some of the key concepts of object-oriented
programming and integrated program development environments with
graphical user interfaces have been contributed to by AI.

## Linguistics (1957 - Present)

Modern linguistics and AI were \"born\" at about the same time, so
linguistics does not play a large foundational role in the growth of AI.
Instead, the two grew up together, intersecting in a hybrid field called
[computational
linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics) or
[natural language
processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing),
which concentrates on the problem of language use.

# How Can we classify if a machine has artificial Intelligence?

In 1950, Alan Turing proposed the [Turing Test](http://psych.utoronto.ca/users/reingold/courses/ai/turing.html),
to determine whether a machine can demonstrate human intelligence, the
basis of AI. The outline of the test is, a \"judge\" converses with two
unseen participants, a person and a computer program through text-chat,
and then decides which is man and which is machine. If the judge is just
as likely to pick the computer as it is human, then the computer has
demonstrated human intelligence. Originally, Turing suggested that the
machine should be able to convince a human 30% of the time after five
minutes of conversation.

The first machine to pass the Turing Test was a chatbot [Eugene Goostman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Goostman), created by
Kevin Warwick in 2014, passing with 33%.

# Examples of Artificial Intelligence

What is classed as AI changes as previous classifications become
outdated. In the past a machine that could calculate basic functions or
recognise text was said to have had artificial intelligence. However, we
now take these functions as standard as part of a computers function.

- Computers playing chess or Go (Google's AI
  [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/) vs South Korean
  Lee Sedol)

- Self-Driving Cars

- Amazon's [Alexa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa)

- Virtual Personal Assistants - Siri, Google Now

- Video Games

- Online Customer Support

- Security

# Issues

There has been many debates in the scientific community and in the
general public about AI. A common idea, played out in many Hollywood
movies is the idea that an AI machine will become so advanced that we,
mere humans, cannot compete. A perhaps, more disconcerting idea is that
they will start to advance at an exponential rate (think [I Robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL6RRIOZyCM) or
[Terminator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k64P4l2Wmeg)).

Another is how these AI machines, will be used. Could they be
weaponized? Will they be used to hack people's private properties?
(_cough_ NSA _cough_ ... Just a joke, don't arrest me please!)

Finally, we get to the ethics surrounding AI. How do we measure
intelligence or humanity? Should an AI machine should have the same
rights as us? This is a very real problem, as of February 2017, Amazon
are declaring that Alexa has the [First Amendment Right of Free Speech](http://fortune.com/2017/02/23/amazon-free-speech-alexa-murder/).

# Future

AI are already so integral in human lives and that dependency we have on
them is only going to increase.

They keep us safe, keep us organised, keep us informed and in the future
they could become part of us. We may be able to use AI to enhance
ourselves, (like Cyborg from DC Comics, not the rigid Doctor Who
[Cyberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberman)) AI could be used to
enhance, not only our physical abilities, allowing us to run faster,
jump higher, live longer, but potentially increase our metal
capabilities, making us smarter, more creative etc (I'd recommend
reading [Nexus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nexus_Trilogy) by
Ramez Naam where the world is able to take a drug that allows them to
have an OS in their brains, connecting minds to minds. Ramez, my check's
in the post ... right?)

Other possibilities, include using AIs to solve world problems, climate
change, wars, mis-management of resources ... mainly problems we've
caused. No wonder in most movies the robots rise up against us.
