Previously ... on Machine Learning
[here](https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/machine-learning.html)

From my blog on Artificial Intelligence
([AI](https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/artificial-intelligence.html)), we
know that when it comes to processing data and creating patterns for
decision making, the aim is to imitate the workings of the human brain.
Deep learning (DL) is a subset of Machine Learning
([ML](https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/machine-learning.html)) and AI. It has
neural networks which are capable of learning unsupervised from data
that is unstructured or unlabeled.

In the digital era, we are getting information from everywhere. [Big
Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) is found from sources such
as social media, internet search engines, online platforms etc. Big Data
is accessible and is shared through FinTech applications such as cloud
computing. However, this data is
[unstructured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data), and so
huge that it would take you and me years to understand and get the
relevant information from it. There is boundless potential in decoding
Big Data, so companies are using AI techniques to do this.

A common techniques to process Big Data is ML. ML uses self-adapting
algorithms to get better at analysis and find patterns with experience
or additional data. More information on ML can be found in my previous
[blog article](https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/machine-learning.html).

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, utilizes a hierarchical
level of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to carry out the process of
machine learning. To understand how Deep Learning Works, we must first
understand ANN.

# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

<Image alt='image' src={ann} />

In DL, the computing systems are designed to simulate how the human
brain analyses and processes information. ANN has self-learning
capabilities that allow it to produce positively correlated results with
the amount of available information.

## How does ANN work?

Artificial neural networks are built like the human brain, with neuron
nodes interconnected like a web. The human brain has hundreds of
billions of cells called _neurons_. Each neuron is made up of a cell
body that is responsible for processing information by carrying
information towards (inputs) and away (outputs) from the brain. ANN has
hundreds or thousands of artificial neurons called _processing units_
which are interconnected by nodes.

These processing units are made up of input and output units. The input
units receive various forms and structures of information. The neural
network attempts to learn about the information presented in order to
produce one output report. Just like humans need rules and guidelines to
come up with a result or output, ANNs also use a set of learning rules
called _Backpropagation_ to perfect their output results.

An ANN goes through a training phase where it learns to recognize
patterns in data. During this supervised phase, the network compares its
actual output produced with the desired output. The difference between
both outcomes is adjusted using backpropagation. At this stage, the
network works backwards, going from the output unit, through the hidden
units to the input units in order to adjust the weight of its
connections between the units. It iterates until the difference between
the actual and desired outcome produces the lowest possible error.

import fd from '../../assets/blog/fraud-detection.jpg'

<Image alt='image' src={fd} />

During the training and supervisory stage, the ANN is taught what to
look for and what its output should be, using Yes/No questions with
binary numbers. For example, a bank that wants to detect credit card
fraud on time may have four input units fed with these questions:

1.  Is the transaction in a different country from the user's resident
    country?

2.  Is the website the card is being used at affiliated with companies
    or countries on the bank's watch list?

3.  Is the transaction amount larger than \$2000?

4.  Is the name on the transaction bill the same as the name of the
    cardholder?

The bank wants the \"fraud detected\" responses to be Yes Yes Yes No
which in binary format would be 1 1 1 0. If the network's actual output
is 1 0 1 0, it adjusts its results until it delivers an output that
coincides with 1 1 1 0. After training, the computer system can alert
the bank of pending fraudulent transactions, saving the bank money.

# ANN Application to Deep Learning

While traditional programs build analysis with data in a linear way, the
hierarchical function of deep learning systems enables machines to
process data with a non-linear approach. A traditional approach to
detecting fraud or money laundering might rely on the amount of
transaction that ensues, while a deep learning non-linear technique to
weeding out a fraudulent transaction would include time, geographic
location, IP address, type of retailer, and any other feature that is
likely to make up a fraudulent activity.

The first layer of the neural network processes, is raw data input, such
as the amount of the transaction. This is then passed on to the next
layer as output. The second layer processes the previous layer's
information by including additional information like the user's IP
address and passes on its result. The next layer takes the second
layer's information and includes raw data like geographic location and
makes the machine's pattern even better. This continues across all
levels of the neuron network until the best output is determined. This
is an example of a _FeedForward Neural Network_.

# Sigmoid Neuron

In ANN we mention weights of neurons. These weighted neurons are called
_Sigmoid Neurons_. Some neural networks use perceptron outputs that have
discrete values of 0 and 1. A sigmoid neuron outputs a smooth continuous
range of values between 0 and 1. This is defined by the Sigmoid Function
defined below,

In ANN, values change very slowly with each iteration and input.
Observing how a small change in the bias value or the weights
(associated with the artificial neurons) affects the overall value of
the output of the the neuron is very important. A
[Perceptron](https://appliedgo.net/perceptron/) may have its outputs
flipped suddenly with a small change in the input value. To observe the
tiny changes in the output to arrive at the correct value of input, we
need a function to be applied on the [dot
product](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors-dot-product.html) of
weights and bias value so that overall output is smooth. For now, the
function could have been any function f() that is smooth in nature, such
as quadratic functions or cubic functions. The reason the sigmoid
function is chosen, is that, exponential functions generally are similar
to handle mathematically and, since learning algorithms involve lots of
differentiation, choosing a function that is computationally cheaper to
handle is wise.

The Sigmoid Neurons are organised into layers, similar to how they are
in the human brain. Neurons on the bottom layer (inputs) receive signals
from the inputs, where neurons in the top layers (outputs) have their
outlets connected to the \"answer,\" Usually there are no connections
between neurons in the same layer. This is an optional restriction, more
complex connectivity's require more involved mathematical analysis. This
is a feed-forward network so there are no connections that lead from a
neuron in a higher layer to a neuron in a lower layer. Alternatively,
there are Recursive Neural Networks
[(RNN)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.3298.pdf). Again, these are much more
complicated to analyze and train.

# BackPropagation

A fundamental idea of DL and ANN is BackPropagation. We have briefly
touched on backpropagation in previous blog articles but we will dive
into the Algorithm into more detail.

The idea behind backpropagation is that we don't know what the hidden
units (the neurons between the input and output) should be doing, but we
do know how fast the error between the iteration and actual result
changes as we change the hidden activity. We want to find the steepest
path from our starting results to the actual result.

Each hidden unit can affect many different output units. We start by
looking at the error
[derivatives](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/derivatives-introduction.html)
for one layer of hidden units. Once we have the error derivatives for
one layer of hidden units, we use them to compute the error derivatives
for the activities of the layer below. Once we find the error
derivatives for the activities of the hidden units, it's relatively easy
to get the error derivatives for the weights leading into a hidden unit.

The symbol \"y\" will refer to the activity of a neuron. The symbol
\"z\" will refer to the logic of a neuron. We start by looking at the
base case of the dynamic programming problem, the error function
derivatives at the output layer:

import dl from '../../assets/blog/dl-maths-1.png'

<Image alt='image' src={dl} />

For the inductive step, let's presume we have the error derivatives for
layer _j_. We now aim to calculate the error derivatives for the layer
below it, layer _i_. To do so, we must accumulate information for how
the output of a neuron in layer _i_ affects the logic of every neuron in
layer _j_. The partial derivative of the logic, with respect to the
incoming output data from the layer beneath, is merely the weight of the
connection _wij_:

import dl2 from '../../assets/blog/dl-maths-2.png'

<Image alt='image' src={dl2} />

To complete the inductive step

import dl3 from '../../assets/blog/dl-maths-3.png'

<Image alt='image' src={dl3} />

Combining, we express the [partial
derivatives](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartialDerivative.html) of
layer _i_ in terms of the partial derivatives of layer _j_.

import dl4 from '../../assets/blog/dl-maths-4.png'

<Image alt='image' src={dl4} />

Next, we determine how the error changes with respect to the weights.
This gives us how to modify the weights after each training example:

import dl5 from '../../assets/blog/dl-maths-5.png'

<Image alt='image' src={dl5} />

For backpropagation with training examples, we sum up the partial
derivatives over all training examples. This gives us the following
modification formula:

import dl6 from '../../assets/blog/dl-maths-6.png'

<Image alt='image' src={dl6} />

This is the Backpropagation Algorithm for Feed-Foward Neural Networks
using Sigmoidal Neurons. In better news, this also the end of the Maths.
You made it through, and I'm sure you're a stronger person for it!

You can find a worked example of BackPropagation

# Future

import ai from '../../assets/blog/ai-race.jpg'

<Image alt='image' src={ai} />

The possibilities for the future of Deep Learning are endless. As
algorithms and technology advances, we may see models that use less
training cases to learn, maybe diving into unsupervised learning. This
could kick start a race between global companies. Apple has recently
been on a hiring mission, seeking 80-plus AI experts to help make
[Siri](https://www.apple.com/ios/siri/) smarter than Google Now or
Microsoft's
[Cortana](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17214/windows-10-what-is).
Google paid \$400 million for [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/) who
specialised in Deep Learning, with Deep Learning experts commanding
seven-figure salaries. They are the Premier League Footballers of the
programming world.

There's a simple reason why, when it comes to Deep Learning and AI,
Google are one of, if not the, market leaders. Data! They have it coming
out of their ears. We have seen that the more training cases you have
for your model, the better it becomes at predictions. Apple, in this
scenario, are hamstrung by their own privacy policies. As an iPhone
encrypts and holds data on the device itself, Apple has little user data
to exploit. A former Apple employee told Reuters that Siri retains user
data for six months, but Apple Maps user data can be gone in as little
as 15 minutes. This pales in comparison to the amount of data that
Google aggregates from Android users around the globe. Potentially, this
disparity may stifle Apple advances in AI-driven technology, and
especially where big data is essential to refine and perfect the
learning process.

recognition, speech, face detection, and other innovations for mobile
platforms.
