# Peer to Peer

[Funding Circle](https://www.fundingcircle.com) is a high profile
peer-to-peer lending marketplace that allows investors to lend money
directly to small and medium-sized businesses. It is built on a big
idea: \*\*\"To revolutionise the outdated banking system and secure a
better deal for everyone\"\*\*.

The business is now global lending huge amounts of money in various
countries. In order to carry doing this successfully and to grow
further, they need their technology to be streamlined and efficient.

They originally used Ruby throughout, but now they have over 40 Clojure
developers spread across multiple countries including the US and the UK.

Clojure is used extensively for the performance sensitive back-end
services, for example making decisions on who to give loans to, the
accounting system, and the handling of interactions with the upstream
banks.

I had a Q and A with Chief Architect Robert Crim who introduced Clojure
to Funding Circle.

# Clojure

_Jon:_ What made you consider Clojure at Funding Circle?

_Robert:_ I learnt functional programming at university where I wrote
some OCaml. I talked about OCaml in the early days at Funding Circle but
we had already committed to Ruby, so I left it on the shelf.

Sometime later, I heard about Clojure and it interested me. I hadn't
done much Lisp outside of Emacs, but I like the idea that in Lisp _[code
is data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity)_, and that the
emphasis is on data structures rather than just types for modelling
purposes. I watched [Rich Hickey's Simple Made
Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) talk and the
simplicity of Clojure clicked.

I figured the fact that Clojure is dynamic could help to bring our Ruby
people across.

There are also the pragmatic aspects of using the JVM; we're heavy
[Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) users and there are native Java client
libraries that we'd want to use.

# Making the Change

import fc2 from '../../assets/blog/fcteam.jpg'

<Image alt='image' src={fc2} />

_Jon:_ What prompted you to consider such a big change in technologies?

_Robert:_ Funding Circle has expanded into multiple countries - often
through acquisition, which has led to us owning lots of different tech
stacks and different versions of software.

I was asking: how can we build something that we can run in different
locations, a new global platform that is easier to maintain?

It's about building for the future, the company now has a global
development team and we needed an architecture with clear standards that
fitted the nature of our business and team organization - we wanted an
edge.

_Jon:_ Why move away from Ruby?

I wanted to get some cognitive dissonance between the old stack and new
one. The old stack was monolithic and we had reams of impenetrable Ruby
code, I wanted to make to a fresh start from that. Choosing Clojure gave
us that little bit extra to make people put a new hat on and to make
them really think about simple code.

# Making the Switch

_Jon:_ Once you made the decision, how did the journey begin?

_Robert:_ It started when Funding Circle entered the US and I started
hiring our engineering team in San Francisco. I talked about a lot
Clojure at the interview stage, and eventually people were asking \"can
we do this in Clojure?\" when new projects came up.

We launched an initial application to try Clojure out. It ran in
production for almost a year without any problems and we felt like it
was a success. Then we started to spin up teams to build the global
platform.

# Hiring

_Jon:_ You built up a large Clojure team, how have you found the hiring
process?

_Robert:_ Hiring good Clojure developers is not any harder than finding
good Ruby developers.

Finding good developers is always hard but at least with Clojure it's a
draw in its own right. People often learn it in their own time and they
really want to do it.

This can have a downside in that occasionally some developers are more
interested in the tech and less interested in our business. The best
developers we have tend to be product focused and incentivized by the
domain they are working in. This was something we needed to be aware of
when speaking with candidates.

# Training

_Jon:_ What's it been like on-boarding developers to Clojure?

_Robert:_ You need enough of a seed of experienced developers that can
teach others. You can't have 10 devs together not knowing the language,
but with a good seeding it can be OK. The key is also to get a critical
mass of excited people; people with a natural interest who want to
evangelise.

_Jon:_ Any challenges?

_Robert:_ I have learnt not to take motivation and confidence for
granted. I assumed early on that everyone would want to learn Clojure,
but some people are really happy with their existing tech stack and not
that keen to jump in. That's totally fine! It ultimately comes down to
the fact that people have different interests and so it's important to
listen to the team.

Also, some people were worried about putting project delivery at risk by
picking up a new language, and so were not as confident in taking things
on, despite being interested in learning Clojure.

_Jon:_ Any tips for dealing with this?

_Robert:_ We did [4Clojure](https://www.4clojure.com/) exercises
together in business hours and spent time getting people more
comfortable. It's important not to project how you would tackle the
problem of picking up learning something new. People have different
levels of uncertainty at start of a project, and this is even more
pronounced the larger the team is.

Also, give time for people to experiment. Let them do spikes and example
throwaway projects.

Lastly we had a couple of training courses done in the UK and US (JUXT
did the UK one).

# Where are you now?

_Robert:_ We have lots of Clojure in production and it's still growing.

A lot of the platform that powers our marketplace is written in Clojure.
We'll still use Ruby on the customer-facing pieces, but a significant
part of the business is back-end. It's the nuts and bolts.

import om from '../../assets/blog/omnextnolen.jpg'

<Image alt='image' src={om} />

The approach we're taking is to _[turn the database inside
out](http://www.erikgfesser.com/weblog/2014/10/strange-loop-conference-2014-turning-the-database-inside-out-with-apache-samza-martin-kleppmann.html)_-
using event streams to drive business logic over Kafka. Clojure is a
good fit for this; mapping functions over unbounded streams.

We now have large teams working concurrently because of the
contract-based approach of our asynchronous events streams. The
bottleneck is more on the data model and not on the code. This is good
because the data model is exactly where we should be focusing our
efforts.

# ClojureScript

_Jon:_ Have you thought about adopting ClojureScript?

We are in places. The Clojure team building back end services is also
building back-end administrative tools using ClojureScript.

We are trying to answer this question: can we have truely vertical
teams, with Clojure developers doing both the front and back end?

ClojureScript and Om.Next are still very Clojure like, and this reduces
the need for separate front-end experts building all the CSS and
JavaScript that can be difficult to maintain. Also having a parallel API
for internal front-end purposes isn't great and Om.Next can cut down on
this. We can then have our front-end team focused on building
high-quality shared component libraries, rather than needing to write
everything that touches a browser.

# State of Clojure

_Jon:_ How do you see Clojure adoption happening in the industry?

_Robert:_ Clojure is definitely being adopted and I hope it continues to
grow. I see a lot of smaller companies and consultancies using it and
also some really big players. It just needs to continue to evolve and
become more approachable.

_Jon:_ What is your view on the current state of Clojure?

_Robert:_ Clojure is not afraid of success. I'm interested to see what
happens with ClojureScript vs Clojure on the JVM, do they get more
compatible or begin to diverge? Which run-time will ultimately win out?
It would be great to have an [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) compiled Clojure.

Also does Clojure need a killer app? Om Next could be one. People assume
there will eventually be a killer app of sorts, but this feels like the
antithesis of Clojure, where it's more of \"here's the language, pick up
the libraries you need and off you go\". So I'm not sure if there will
ever be a huge draw to the language other than the language itself. But
that should be enough!

I'm also happy to see Spec. Ultimately, Cognitect are good stewards of
the language - it's good tech moving at a good pace and I feel like
everything we're building now will carry on working for years to come.

## Final Thoughts

_Jon:_ Are you glad you've chosen Clojure?

_Robert:_ Clojure has held up its end and more. It's a fantastic
language and the code is very maintainable.

_Jon:_ Any other technologies you'd like to give a shout out to?

We use [Riemann](http://riemann.io/) heavily; it's fantastic piece of
technology for solving a lot the perennial monitoring and metrics
gathering challenges that non-trivial systems face - it's great. I also
really like Elm and would like to get the chance to use it more, but
we're not going down that road anytime soon at Funding Circle!
