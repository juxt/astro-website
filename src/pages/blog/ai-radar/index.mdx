# JUXT AI Radar

**An opinionated guide to the AI landscape from JUXT, a Grid Dynamics company**

Welcome to the first edition of the JUXT AI Radar, where we map the landscape of AI tools, technologies, frameworks, and practices based on our collective expertise and client experiences. Our committee of technology experts has carefully evaluated each entry based on real-world applications, industry trends, and practical utility. This radar represents our current viewpoint and will evolve as the rapidly changing AI ecosystem matures.

## Radar Overview

Our radar is organized into four main categories, each containing technologies evaluated across four adoption levels:

- **Adopt**: Technologies we recommend using now
- **Trial**: Worth exploring for new projects
- **Assess**: Keep under observation
- **Hold**: Not recommended for new projects

## Categories

### [Techniques](/blog/ai-radar/techniques/)

AI methodologies, approaches, and practices that shape how we build intelligent systems.

- **[Adopt](/blog/ai-radar/techniques/adopt/)**: Classical ML, RAG, LLM-as-a-Judge, BERT variants, Few-shot prompting
- **[Trial](/blog/ai-radar/techniques/trial/)**: Cross-encoder reranking, Chain of Thought (CoT), Model Distillation & Synthetic data, UMAP
- **[Assess](/blog/ai-radar/techniques/assess/)**: Structured RAG, Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE), Fine-tuning with LoRA, Agentic tool use
- **[Hold](/blog/ai-radar/techniques/hold/)**: Word2Vec & GloVe, t-SNE, Zero-shot prompting, AI Pull Request Review

### [Languages & Frameworks](/blog/ai-radar/languages-frameworks/)

Programming languages, libraries, and frameworks that power AI development.

- **[Adopt](/blog/ai-radar/languages-frameworks/adopt/)**: PyTorch, dbt, Anthropic Model Context Protocol
- **[Trial](/blog/ai-radar/languages-frameworks/trial/)**: AutoGen, DeepEval, LlamaIndex
- **[Assess](/blog/ai-radar/languages-frameworks/assess/)**: Prolog, JAX, LangChain & LangGraph, PydanticAI, Smolagents
- **[Hold](/blog/ai-radar/languages-frameworks/hold/)**: TensorFlow, Keras, R, OpenCL

### [Tools](/blog/ai-radar/tools/)

Software tools and utilities that enhance AI development workflows.

- **[Adopt](/blog/ai-radar/tools/adopt/)**: Software Engineering Copilots, Provider-agnostic LLM facades, Notebooks
- **[Trial](/blog/ai-radar/tools/trial/)**: Agentic Computer Use
- **[Assess](/blog/ai-radar/tools/assess/)**: AI Application Bootstrappers
- **[Hold](/blog/ai-radar/tools/hold/)**: Conversational data analysis

### [Platforms](/blog/ai-radar/platforms/)

Infrastructure and platform services that support AI applications.

- **[Adopt](/blog/ai-radar/platforms/adopt/)**: Weights & Biases, Foundation models
- **[Trial](/blog/ai-radar/platforms/trial/)**: MLflow, Open weight LLMs, Lakera, Vector Databases
- **[Assess](/blog/ai-radar/platforms/assess/)**: Crew.ai, Galileo.ai, Kubeflow
- **[Hold](/blog/ai-radar/platforms/hold/)**: Building against vendor-specific APIs

## Methodology

Our evaluation process considers several factors:

- **Real-world applicability**: How well does it work in production environments?
- **Community adoption**: Is there active development and community support?
- **Performance characteristics**: Speed, accuracy, and resource requirements
- **Integration complexity**: How easy is it to integrate into existing systems?
- **Future potential**: Long-term viability and growth prospects

## Contributing

This radar represents our current viewpoint and will be updated regularly. We welcome feedback and suggestions from the community. Each technology entry includes detailed reasoning for its placement, helping you make informed decisions for your AI projects.
