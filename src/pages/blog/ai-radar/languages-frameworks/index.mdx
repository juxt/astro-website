Programming languages and frameworks form the backbone of AI development, providing the tools and abstractions needed to build intelligent systems. From established libraries to emerging frameworks, these technologies enable developers to create sophisticated AI applications efficiently.

## Adoption Levels

Our languages and frameworks are evaluated based on performance, ecosystem maturity, and developer experience:

### [Adopt](/blog/ai-radar/languages-frameworks/adopt/)

Mature, well-supported languages and frameworks ready for production use.

**Featured technologies**: PyTorch, dbt, Anthropic Model Context Protocol

### [Trial](/blog/ai-radar/languages-frameworks/trial/)

Promising technologies with growing adoption and active development.

**Featured technologies**: AutoGen, DeepEval, LlamaIndex

### [Assess](/blog/ai-radar/languages-frameworks/assess/)

Emerging or specialized technologies that may be worth considering for specific use cases.

**Featured technologies**: Prolog, JAX, LangChain & LangGraph, PydanticAI, Smolagents

### [Hold](/blog/ai-radar/languages-frameworks/hold/)

Technologies that are either declining in relevance or have better alternatives available.

**Featured technologies**: TensorFlow, Keras, R, OpenCL

## Evaluation Criteria

When assessing languages and frameworks, we consider:

- **Performance**: Speed, memory efficiency, and scalability
- **Ecosystem**: Available libraries, tools, and community support
- **Learning curve**: Developer experience and documentation quality
- **Production readiness**: Stability, testing capabilities, and deployment options
- **Future outlook**: Active development and long-term viability

## Technology Stack Considerations

Building AI applications often requires combining multiple languages and frameworks. Consider:

- **Interoperability**: How well technologies work together
- **Team expertise**: Available skills and learning requirements
- **Project requirements**: Specific needs for performance, scalability, or specialized functionality
- **Maintenance**: Long-term support and community activity

## Getting Started

Begin with **Adopt** technologies for proven solutions, explore **Trial** options for innovation, and carefully evaluate **Assess** technologies for specialized needs.
