These AI techniques show interesting potential but require careful evaluation before adoption. They represent emerging approaches that may offer significant benefits but also come with uncertainties about long-term viability, implementation complexity, or practical applicability.

## Structured RAG

Structured RAG represents an evolution of traditional retrieval-augmented generation that incorporates structured data and knowledge graphs. While this approach promises more accurate and contextually relevant responses, the complexity of implementation and the need for well-structured knowledge bases make it challenging to evaluate. The technique may be valuable for specific domains with rich structured data.

## Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)

HyDE offers an innovative approach to information retrieval by generating hypothetical documents to improve search queries. The technique shows promise for improving retrieval performance, but questions remain about its reliability across different domains and the computational overhead involved. Further research and real-world validation are needed to assess its practical value.

## Fine-tuning with LoRA

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising technique for efficient model fine-tuning, but its effectiveness varies significantly across different models and tasks. While LoRA can dramatically reduce computational requirements, the trade-offs between performance and efficiency need careful consideration. The technique requires expertise to implement effectively.

## Agentic Tool Use

Agentic approaches to AI, where models can autonomously use tools and APIs, represent an exciting frontier in AI development. However, the complexity of implementation, potential for errors, and security considerations make this technique challenging to evaluate. The approach may be valuable for specific use cases but requires careful risk assessment.
