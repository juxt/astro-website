AI platforms provide the infrastructure, services, and tools needed to build, deploy, and scale intelligent applications. From cloud-based services to specialized AI infrastructure, these platforms enable organizations to leverage AI capabilities without building everything from scratch.

## Adoption Levels

Our platforms are evaluated based on reliability, performance, cost-effectiveness, and ecosystem maturity:

### [Adopt](/blog/ai-radar/platforms/adopt/)

Mature, reliable platforms that are essential for AI development and deployment.

**Featured platforms**: Weights & Biases, Foundation models

### [Trial](/blog/ai-radar/platforms/trial/)

Promising platforms with growing adoption and innovative capabilities.

**Featured platforms**: MLflow, Open weight LLMs, Lakera, Vector Databases

### [Assess](/blog/ai-radar/platforms/assess/)

Emerging platforms that show potential but require careful evaluation.

**Featured platforms**: Crew.ai, Galileo.ai, Kubeflow

### [Hold](/blog/ai-radar/platforms/hold/)

Platforms that either have limited value, better alternatives, or pose vendor lock-in risks.

**Featured platforms**: Building against vendor-specific APIs

## Platform Categories

AI platforms can be categorized into several areas:

- **Model Training**: Platforms for training and fine-tuning AI models
- **Model Serving**: Infrastructure for deploying and serving AI models
- **Data Management**: Tools for storing, processing, and managing AI data
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Services for tracking AI system performance
- **Development Tools**: Integrated development environments and utilities

## Platform Selection Criteria

When evaluating AI platforms, consider:

- **Scalability**: Ability to handle growing workloads and data volumes
- **Performance**: Speed, latency, and throughput capabilities
- **Cost structure**: Pricing models and total cost of ownership
- **Integration**: Compatibility with existing tools and workflows
- **Vendor lock-in**: Dependency on specific platforms or services
- **Compliance**: Security, privacy, and regulatory requirements

## Infrastructure Considerations

Building AI applications requires careful infrastructure planning:

- **Compute resources**: GPU/CPU requirements for training and inference
- **Storage solutions**: Data storage and retrieval capabilities
- **Networking**: Data transfer and API access requirements
- **Security**: Access controls, encryption, and compliance measures
- **Monitoring**: Observability and alerting for production systems

## Getting Started

Begin with **Adopt** platforms for proven infrastructure, explore **Trial** options for innovation, and carefully evaluate **Assess** platforms for specialized needs while avoiding **Hold** platforms that may limit flexibility.
