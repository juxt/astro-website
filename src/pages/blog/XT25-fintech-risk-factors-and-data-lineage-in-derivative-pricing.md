The [XT25 Fintech Conference](https://www.juxt.pro/xt25/), held on June 12th, opened with a powerful keynote by Charlie Browne, Head of Market Data, Quant & Risk solutions at [GoldenSource](https://www.thegoldensource.com), setting the tone for a day of insight-driven, technical exploration.

In his talk, titled 'Risk Factors and Data Lineage in Derivative Pricing', Charlie examined the growing regulatory pressure on financial institutions to bring transparency and traceability to the data used in pricing and risk management, especially in the post-Basel III landscape.

From the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis to the implementation of FRTB, CVA, and stress testing regimes, regulation has continued to evolve. But as Charlie argued, we have now entered a new phase: the regulatory data pivot.

Regulators are no longer just concerned with capital rules and risk models, they are demanding clear, auditable data lineage on the risk factors behind derivative pricing. This includes the ability to trace inputs like market data through every edit, validation, transformation, and model-fitting step.

Charlie explored how this impacts two key areas:

- Point-in-time pricing and no-arbitrage valuations

- Time-series risk factor generation for measures like VaR and Expected Shortfall

With global standards such as BCBS 239, RDARR, and CPG 235 pushing the agenda, data lineage is becoming not just a best practice, but a regulatory necessity.
