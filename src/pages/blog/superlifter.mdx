So far, so simple. That's because the resolvers are only given a single
job to resolve one piece of data. They are decoupled and therefore
reusable which is great when you have a graph where nodes can be reached
from many edges.

To get the names and kinds of all your pets you issue the following
query:

```graphql
;; tag::query[]
{
  pets {
    kind
    name
  }
}
;; end::query[]
```

You have _n_ pets (your pet store is very successful) but that means the
query is taking quite a long time to resolve. You are making 1+n calls
to PetDB and paying the overhead of a call 1+n times in serial.

import ns from '../../assets/blog/naive-sequence.svg'

<img src={ns} />

If you queried for both kind and name of the pets you would make 1+2n
calls and the performance would be twice as bad.

# The incredible bulk

You discover that PetDB has a bulk endpoint where you could fetch
details for multiple pets in one call.

- `/api/pets/:id0,:id1,:id2...`

The problem is there's no straightforward way to take advantage of it.
Your resolvers for the pet details are run in isolation from each other
and the only hook you have is the top level pets resolver. What if you
did all the work in there?

```clj

This works, but you've complected your pets resolver with the work of
the children. You can't reuse the child resolvers from another edge in
the graph now without duplicating this work in all those other parent
resolvers.

# n wrongs make a right

The DataLoader pattern has an answer, allowing you to keep your
resolvers simple and reusable yet still take advantage of the bulk
endpoint.

> DataLoader allows you to decouple unrelated parts of your application
> without sacrificing the performance of batch data-loading. While the

The way it works is by providing a bucket into which you can throw all
the fetches that your resolvers want to do, and returning a promise for
each one. Then, usually after a given time interval, the fetches are
coalesced (deduplicated and combined) and performed, delivering the
individual results back to the promises.

# superlifter

[superlifter](https://github.com/oliyh/superlifter) is a Clojure
implementation of the DataLoader pattern. It has the following features:

- Fast, simple implementation of DataLoader pattern

- Bucketing by time or by queue size

- Asynchronous fetching

- Batching of fetches

- Shared cache for all fetches in a session

- Guarantees consistent results

- Avoids duplicating work

- Access to the cache allows longer-term persistence

Here's how to set it up.

## Start a superlifter per query

A superlifter should live for the lifetime of a query, ensuring
consistent results for duplicate reads and capturing and executing all
fetches. In lacinia the queries are processed using interceptor chains,
so superlifter provides an interceptor that starts a superlifter with
your options:

```clj
(ns superlifter
  (:require [clj-http.client :as http]
            [clojure.string :as str]))

;; tag::vanilla-resolvers[]

           (assoc details :id id))
         ids details)))

```

Note also that we are injecting data so you can see the data we are
working with, but normally this would be a database connection or http
library. Our default bucket performs a fetch every 10ms of everything
that's in it at the time. You can add buckets later at runtime for
specific purposes - I'll cover this later on.

## Describe your fetches

We now need a way to describe our fetches before we perform them, so
that we have a chance of introspecting them in order to deduplicate and
batch before executing. The [urania](https://github.com/funcool/urania)
library is used for this, so you can implement those protocols if you
want the full power of urania, but superlifter provides a abstraction
over them with `def-fetcher` and `def-superfetcher` that gives a simpler
API.

```clj
(ns superlifter
  (:require [clj-http.client :as http]
            [clojure.string :as str]))

  (with-superlifter context
    (s/enqueue! :pet-details (->FetchPet id))))

;; end::superlifter-resolvers-size[]
```

See how the `def-superfetcher` implementation has the opportunity to
combine multiple `FetchPet` requests into one. This is where we take
advantage of any bulk APIs to speed things up!

## Chuck \'em in the (time) bucket

We can now write our resolvers to put our fetches into the superlifter
bucket:

```

The `resolve-pets` resolver puts a fetch into the bucket which will be
performed within the next 10ms. It returns 3 pet ids, after which the
`resolve-pet-details` resolver will run 3 times. Instead of performing 3
separate fetches, those three fetches go into the bucket and are
combined into one fetch which will be performed within the next 10ms.

A time bucket of 10ms means you will add up to 10ms to each layer of the
query. 10ms might be relatively small but will add up quickly if you
query is many layers deep, but making it smaller may mean your fetches
span multiple buckets and you lose some efficiency. One of the
worst-case scenarios is shown below, with yellow indicating wasted time.

## Size buckets

In some cases (like when fetching our pet details) we already know how
many fetches we are going to make because our parent has given us a
list. You can create a new bucket in superlifter for this purpose with a
particular size, rather than time window. The fetch is triggered when
the number of items in the bucket meets the threshold, saving the cost
of waiting for an interval to elapse:

The default bucket has a queue size of 1. The `resolve-pets` resolver
puts its fetch in the default bucket, which will be performed
immediately, and then adds a new bucket called `:pet-details` which has
a size of 3, because we know we will fetch details for the 3 pets we
have found.

The `resolve-pet-details` resolver then puts all its fetches into the
`:pet-details` bucket and as soon as the third resolver has run the
combined fetch will be performed immediately. No time lost and maximum
efficiency!

# More features

superlifter exposes the cache that is used for fetches, allowing you to
prepopulate it from a long-term or shared store before execution and
read the results of new fetches after execution to write them to the
store. This gives you even finer grained control over how often you
perform fetches.

The existing triggers (interval and size) are implemented using
multimethods. You can implement your own by participating in them! There
is also a \"manual mode\" without any triggers, allowing you to let the
bucket fill and perform the fetches on demand (for example in response
to a user pressing a button). You can use any permutation of triggers at
the same time - the fetch will be performed when any are satisfied.

In addition, you can create as many buckets as you want, each with their
own triggers, and put fetches into their most appropriate bucket. This
lets you achieve the best performance and efficiency possible but still
keep your resolvers decoupled.

[superlifter](https://github.com/oliyh/superlifter) is on Github with
the code for this post in the [example
project](https://github.com/oliyh/superlifter/tree/master/example).
Feedback is very welcome, along with any features you'd like to see or
issues. I have future plans to support Clojurescript, add a \"debounced
time\" bucket (which triggers after a fixed quiet period) and improve
the API around creating buckets dynamically.
