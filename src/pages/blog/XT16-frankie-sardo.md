Frankie is our resident mobile expert, having written many commercial
mobile applications in his career, particularly in Android.

For XT16, we asked him to present his current thinking about mobile app
development.

[Last week](/blog/posts/live-programming-websites.html) I wrote about
how instant feedback loops can transform the developer's experience of
writing code, not only speeding development but that the freestyle
experimentation it enables can improve the user's overall experience.

In this talk, Frankie shows how to create such a live programming
environment based on Apache's [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) for
developing mobile appications using
[boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot) and
[boot-reload](https://github.com/adzerk-oss/boot-reload). Of course,
Frankie uses the [Clojure](/why-clojure.html) language to develop the
app itself.

Frankie also demonstrates the advantages of sticking to the web
programming model to reduce the cognitive load of having to learn
multiple mobile eco-systems, which causes developers to drift into
specialist skills silos.

At around [14:00](https://youtu.be/CS7_Rt66NNs?t=853) Frankie extends
the demonstratration to target the browser, iOS and Android
simultaneously.

It's a quick talk, packed full of good advice, we hope you enjoy it.

Frankie has uploaded his demo to his GitHub where you can find all the
[technical details](https://github.com/frankiesardo/reload-demo) to help
get you set up.

So if you worried about developing mobile apps for all mobile platforms,
Frankie says relax!
