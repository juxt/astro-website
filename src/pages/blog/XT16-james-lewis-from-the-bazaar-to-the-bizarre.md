James Lewis is a thinker and a coder, a speaker and an educator, and is
a man with a fantastic memory and vision. I have known him for over ten
years and have seen him become a member of the ThoughtWorks Technical
Advisory Board, contributing to the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar and
industry adoption of open source, techniques, platforms and languages.

He opened our XT16 conference discussing the past, present and future of
software development asking fundamental questions such as _what makes
great software?_ and what is the impact of the large companies moving in
and dominating the open source scene. He looks ahead at future trends of
software development and where we are heading, the massive changes on
the horizon that are fast bearing down on us.

At one stage he introduces us to the _NPM Drinking Game_ - call out a
noun and if you can NPM install that noun - you get a drink!
