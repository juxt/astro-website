In this engaging episode of the JUXT Cast, Jeremy Taylor and Malcolm Sparks sit down with Ryan Robitaille, the founder of [Rabbit](https://github.com/ryrobes/rvbbit). Ryan shares his unique journey—from working with Oracle systems as a young Solutions Engineer to becoming a creative force in the world of data visualization.

Ryan explores his experience building Rabbit, a tool designed to bridge the gap between proprietary BI tools and custom-built engineering solutions. Frustrated by the limitations of traditional tools like Tableau, Ryan envisioned a platform that offers the "best of both worlds": the simplicity of drag-and-drop dashboards with the power and flexibility of live coding and version control.

## Key Takeaways from the Episode:

- The Origins of Rabbit: How Ryan’s passion for combining artistry and data engineering sparked the creation of a platform that feels like a "game engine for data."
- Balancing Build vs. Buy: Insights into the perpetual organizational dilemma of purchasing BI tools versus building in-house solutions.
- Clojure’s Role: How Clojure and its philosophy of "code is data" played a pivotal role in Rabbit's architecture and flexibility.
- The Tableau Experience: Ryan reflects on Tableau's transformative early days and where the tool has hit its limits.
- Empowering End-Users: Why Ryan believes tools should offer a low bar for entry but a high ceiling for complexity.
  With fascinating anecdotes and deep technical insights, this episode sheds light on how data platforms can evolve to empower creativity, transparency, and collaboration.
