In this post I'm going to explain in a rough high level about how the
nREPL you use every day actually works. This isn't intended to be 100%
accurate, but close enough that you can build a mental model for
understanding it when it goes wrong.

# Client/Server

A common confusion is that `lein repl` is not the same as nREPL. When
you run `lein repl`, two things happen:

1.  A server is started by running `tools.nrepl/start-server`.

2.  REPL-y, a terminal nREPL client is launched

The server aspect is the focus of this post. REPL-y is a terminal UI
nREPL client, it allows you to evaluate code from the terminal. Another
client is CIDER.el, which communicates via nREPL to enhance emacs with
features. It also has an nREPL server extension, CIDER-nREPL, which is
written in Clojure.

# Transport Layer

The nREPL has the notion of a transport. This is an abstract concept of
communicating with the nREPL, for sending & receiving messages. The
default transport (ergo most popular) is bencode over tcp. Bencode is a
simple encoding format designed by Bittorrent for encoding torrent
files.

It can be described concisely:

```clojure
;; A number, i prefix, e marks the end
i10e ;; 10

;; A string, <length>: prefix. Length is bytes (for unicode)
4:spam ;; "spam"
6:poop💩 ;; "poop💩" the unicode symbol is 2 bytes

;; A list, l prefix, e marks the end, elements nest
li1ei2ei3ee ;; [1 2 3]
l4:spami2ei3ee ;; ["spam" 2 3]

;; An associative array (hash map)
d3:foo3:bari1e4:spame ;; {"foo" "bar", 1 "spam"}
```

This provides a very simple format for reading data structures over the
network. Other transports exist such as
[drawbridge](https://github.com/cemerick/drawbridge), a HTTP transport;
and
[nrepl-hornetq](https://github.com/pallet/ritz/tree/develop/nrepl-hornetq)
which provides a HornetQ transport for tools.nrepl server.

Each client has to support the various transports natively within it.
Some clients are open to extension, but the primary transport remains
bencode over tcp. I don't doubt this is related to the high cost of
rewriting multiple transports for each client.

# Messages

A message is simply a map; there are two kinds of message, a request and
a response. There are common keys in a request message:

- **id:** Is a unique id for the message, that should be included in
  the request message. Responses relating to this request should also
  include this same id.

- **op:** Specifies what to do. In a way, it's specifying which
  handler to run; `eval` is a common operation, as is `stdin`.

- **session:** This specifies an id which relates to a set of thread
  bindings. I'll cover this in more detail later.

An unencoded request message to an nREPL server could look like this:

```clojure
{:op "eval" :code "(println (+ 1 2))" :id "some-unique-id"}
```

The nREPL server then handles this message however it pleases. I'll
cover specifically how tools.nrepl handles this internally later in the
post.

Responses have a similar shape. A single request can elicit many
responses. When the request has finished being processed, it should
include `"done"` in the list of `:status` values. It's important that
the response `:id` is the same request as the `:id`, this allows a
client to track particular responses, this is due to the nrepl server
being asyncronous in design. You can have multiple requests in flight at
a time. For this reason, it's important that the `:id` is globally
unique, I generally use a UUIDv4.

For the example request above, I would expect 2 response maps like such:

```clojure
{:id "some-unique-id" :out "3"}
{:id "some-unique-id" :value "nil" :status ["done"]}
```

# Sessions

Sessions persist [dynamic vars](https://clojure.org/reference/vars)
(collected by
[`get-thread-bindings`](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/get-thread-bindings))
against a unique lookup. This is allows you to have a different value
for
[`*e`](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/*e)
from different REPL clients (e.g. two separate REPL-y instances). An
existing session can be cloned to create a new one, which then can be
modified. This allows for copying of existing preferences into new
environments.

Sessions become even more useful when different nREPL extensions start
taking advantage of them.
[debug-repl](https://github.com/gfredericks/debug-repl/) uses sessions
to store information about the current breakpoint, allowing debugging of
two things separately.
[piggieback](https://github.com/cemerick/piggieback/) uses sessions to
allow host a clojurescript repl alongside an existing clojure one.

An easy mistake is to confuse a session with an id. The difference
between a session and id, is that an id is for tracking a single
message, and sessions are for tracking remote state. They're fundamental
to allowing simultaneous activities in the same nREPL.

# Internals of tools.nrepl Message Handling

This section deals specifically with how tools.nrepl, the most popular
implementation of nREPL, is implemented. Messages are handled via
[middleware](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki/Concepts#middleware).
This will feel familiar if you have used Ring.

import un from '../../assets/blog/unix-system-its-a-middleware-system-i-know-this.jpg'

<Image alt='image' src={un} />

tools.nREPL middleware works slightly differently to how ring middleware
works, because you can handle the message _and_ pass it on to the next
handler. This is because responses are asyncronous.

A `:transport` key is added to messages as they are handled. The value
of this key is an implementation of a protocol representing the
transport layer. By replacing the transport with a new one, middleware
can control the responses of middleware after it. Usually the
replacement delegates back to the original transport, after updating the
message or doing something with it.

```clojure
;; Print out messages as they happen
(fn [next-fn transport]
  (next-fn (reify TransportProtocol
             (send [_ msg]
               (prn msg)
               (send transport msg)))))

;; Add pretty printed versions of values
(fn [next-fn transport]
  (next-fn (reify TransportProtocol
             (send [_ msg]
               (send transport
                     (assoc msg :pprint-value (pprint (:value msg))))))))
```

The default functionality of the nREPL is implemented entirely using
middleware. Even the fundamental parts like sessions and eval. Default
functionality like eval is provided in order to be useful out of the
box.

## Middleware Descriptors

A message handler can set a descriptor upon itself. This is metadata
which tools.nrepl uses to order middleware automatically and generate
documentation.

`:requires` This specifies middleware which must be present _before_
this middleware in the stack. Specifying a string indicates that
anything which provides this op must be present, you can also also use
vars here.

`:expects` This specifies middleware which must be present _after_ this
middleware in the stack. Again, use vars or strings here.

`:handles` This is a documentation key. It includes text strings for
human explanations of your returns, arguments, etc.

Using the `:requires` and `:expects` key, tools.nrepl is able to
automatically order the middleware and handlers automatically. This is
why you do not have to manually order middleware like so in
`.lein/profile.clj`:

```clojure
:nrepl-middleware (cider (pr-values (eval)))
```

# Practical Example: Piggieback

Piggieback is an nREPL middleware by Chas Emerick. It underlies the
ability to execute Clojurescript over the nREPL. It's used in figwheel
and boot-cljs-\*

To launch a Piggieback session you clone the current nREPL session, and
update a dynamic var in Piggieback. The dynamic var stores a repl env,
which is a clojurescript protocol for evaluation.

Piggieback uses the nREPL middleware dependency system to specify that
`eval` should be after it in the chain. This allows it to \"hijack\" an
incoming `eval`. It will use it's dynamic vars to determine whether or
not Clojurescript is activated.

If it's dynamic var is set, it will use the clojurescript api to send
code to the repl-env. Usually, it's a browser env, so it will be sent to
your browser for evaluation, the result will be captured by the
javascript & sent back. This communication is done via websockets, out
of band.

This setup allows you to evaluate Clojure and Clojurescript in the same
nREPL, by changing the session you're using to control where the
evaluation happens.

# CIDER-nrepl's place in all this

CIDER-nrepl provides a lot of functionality which works around the
limitations imposed by bencode, providing additional semantic data not
available when using `eval`. All `eval` responses get \`\`pr-str\`\`\'d
in order to prevent issues with encoding.

For example, it turns the classpath into a bencode list, as opposed to
to the string `"(\"src/\" \"resources/\")"` that you'd get from using
eval to do the same thing.

It also bundles dependencies in a unique way, via [Mr.
Anderson](https://github.com/benedekfazekas/mranderson), so that they
don't conflict with your project. This means for example, that it brings
tools.namespace in order to provide a refresh, without conflicting with
the version already in your project.

The open design of CIDER-nrepl has allowed unexpected clients such as
vim-fireplace to have a number of additional features with only
integration effort.
