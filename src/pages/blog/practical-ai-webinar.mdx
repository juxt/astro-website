AI has exploded onto the scene in recent months, but despite the constant media barrage it looks like the industry is only just starting to warm up to the potential of LLMs and agentic systems.

If you want a first-hand look at some of the ways engineers are applying some of these new technologies to old problems — watch this on-demand video of my recent webinar, where I share how I’m updating his development process and squashing new features into a couple lines of prompt.

### Key Takeaways

1. An overview of the current LLM landscape — moving past chat completion into the development of AI agents, touching on Local solutions, their pros and cons.

2. The product side of AI — examples and stories of features that used to require research teams, now implemented in an API call.

3. Working with AI — how hard is it to build an AI agent from the perspective of the code? What does it mean to wrangle a system with infinite context into a specific use case?

4. Developing with AI — how can you immediately improve your workflow by letting the ChatGPT lay the groundwork, learn about building a Micro-SaaS with OpenAI Assistants API.

Watch me, as I attempt to espouse the hands-on learnings every developer will come to understand over the next 5 years, sharing takeaways I gathered from trying to build the ultimate google calendar interface.

From inspiring backstories, to model price comparisons, to musings on the future — I guarantee you'll walk away with at least one enlightening fact!

**Jack Tolley — Engineer @ JUXT** — As a software engineer at JUXT, I'm deep in the throes of working with Clojure — helping our customers get their vision off the ground by moving fast and getting things done. <br/>
When I'm not attending hackathons — where I enjoy the free food and meeting other enthusiastic techies — I'm working on personal projects. My current focus is CalendarCompanion: a Google extension designed to eliminate the tedious copying of information into google calendar from peoples other web-based tools. This also entails trying to make sense of this new "Digital Marketing" skill I've been hearing so much about. <br/>
