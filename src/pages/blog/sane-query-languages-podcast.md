Our guest is Prof. Viktor Leis, a Full Professor in the Computer Science Department at the Technical University of Munich. His research revolves around designing high-performance data management systems and includes core database systems topics such as query processing, query optimization, transaction processing, index structures, and storage. [0] <br/>

In this episode we discussed a paper that Viktor recently co-authored with Thomas Neumann, titled "A Critique of Modern SQL And A Proposal Towards A Simple and Expressive Query Language", for CIDR 2024. [2]
Beyond the specifics of SQL, many other topics are touched on also including: machine learning in the database, a critique of PostgreSQL, and the potential for massive performance gains in the world of practical database systems.
