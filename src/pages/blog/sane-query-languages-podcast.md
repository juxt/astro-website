In this episode we discussed a paper that Viktor recently co-authored with Thomas Neumann, titled "A Critique of Modern SQL And A Proposal Towards A Simple and Expressive Query Language", for CIDR 2024. [2]
Beyond the specifics of SQL, many other topics are touched on also including: machine learning in the database, a critique of PostgreSQL, and the potential for massive performance gains in the world of practical database systems.
