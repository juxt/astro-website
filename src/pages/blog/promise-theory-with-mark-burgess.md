Formerly a professor at Oslo University College in Norway and the creator of the CFEngine software and company, Mark was invited to write the [foreward](https://sre.google/sre-book/foreword/) to Google's 2016 book: "Site Reliability Engineering - How Google runs production systems".

We discussed Mark's journey to developing Promise Theory and explored techniques to 'scale simplicity' in the creation of large, reliable systems. One common (yet false) assumption is that all components of a system can be trusted to be 100% reliable. This misconception can lead to costly workarounds in production.

We touched on the 'congruence' debate, considering whether and to what extent we should be concerned with the inherent inefficiencies in 'the automated building of things from scratch.'

We also discussed the counter-intuitive observation that digital systems are far more complex and less resilient than analog systems, and how this may be due to the absence of an error-correcting mechanism in digital systems to maintain equilibrium.

Please let us know if you have any points to add or if you were inspired by any part of the discussion.
