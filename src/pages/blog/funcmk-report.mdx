JUXT have a developer centre in Milton Keynes, which is a town north of
London, UK. We're very close to where Alan Turing worked in the 1940s.
As a group of tech enthusiasts, we enjoy being part of and contributing
to the local tech scene here.

Last week, we hosted the second meeting of [Func
MK](https://www.meetup.com/FuncMK/), a functional programming group in
Milton Keynes that we help organise. The goal of the meetup was to give
people a chance to experience Clojure development first-hand, by
building a simple twitter clone.

To help with the exercise, we put together a tutorial for the event
which used our [Edge project](https://github.com/juxt/edge) as the
springboard. When you only have a couple of hours to build something,
it's good to have a working development environment set up and ready to
go.

Members came with a diverse set of laptops running Windows, Ubuntu and
OS X. Editors ranged from the old (Emacs and vi) to the new, such as
Visual Studio Code (VSC). It was great to see the Edge experience on all
these different platforms.

We felt the event went really well and lots of members said they enjoyed
the experience. So, we're publishing the exercise for others to use. The
exercise is designed for new programmers who have little or no Clojure
experience, but it is challenging enough for more experienced
developers.

The exercise and sample code are published under the same MIT license as
Edge, so feel free to print out the PDF and use as the material for your
own meetup, training course or other event. We'd love to hear how you
get on!

And if you've caught the Clojure bug and want to work with Clojure
professionally, why not come and work for us? We have open positions in
both Milton Keynes and East London.
