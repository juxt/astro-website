<BlogPostLayout frontmatter={frontmatter}>
Recently I attended the two-day Deep Learning Summit in London, hosted
by [Re-Work](https://www.re-work.co/). As someone who is still
relatively new to the deep learning community, I felt a little
apprehensive before attending, but these fears were quickly alleviated
by the very high quality of the talks that were split into digestible
chunks of 20 minutes. Each talk gave a good taster either on what the
individual was researching or what their company did.

There was a large variety of talks from established companies such as
Google's Deep Mind, Facebook and Amazon, and from small start-ups, under
a year old, such as [Echobox](https://www.echobox.com/) and
[UIzard](https://uizard.io/), showcasing the interesting and diverse
areas to which deep neural networks can be applied.

The event was very well organized. Re-Work grouped related talks
together, so each talk was able to build on talks before it, to allow
engagement of one topic at a time. There were talks about research and
application of neural networks; some went into detail, and others gave
more of a general overview about the application of deep learning.

I found Bayesian Neural Networks particularly interesting. This is where
instead of having a single weight value, it is a distribution, allowing
you to utilise the uncertainty around the value. I also found
encoder/decoder neural networks fascinating.

I would go again next year as deep learning is a rapidly-moving field.

Here is a summary of the talks at the event:

# Probability & Uncertainty in Deep Learning, [Andreas Damianou](https://twitter.com/adamianou), [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/)

This talk covered how Neural Network are
[deterministic](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-stochastic-neural-network-and-how-does-it-differ-from-a-deterministic-one).
They are have generalisation, data generation and no predictive
uncertainty. [Bayesian Neural
Networks](http://edwardlib.org/tutorials/bayesian-neural-network) were
introduced here, where instead of single values for weight, a
distribution is used. By using a distribution, you can use all the
available information instead of just mode (single value) for
propagation. This is an example of a [Deep Gausian
Processes](http://keyonvafa.com/deep-gaussian-processes/), however it is
more challenging when the uncertainty has to be propagated

# Sequence to Sequence Networks for Speech & Language Translation, [Shubho Sengupta](https://twitter.com/search?q=facebook&src=tyah), [Facebook AI Research (FAIR)](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research-fair/)

Translation is the single biggest network for any company.
[Siri](https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/siri/) and
[Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-And-Alexa-Devices/b?ie=UTF8&node=9818047011)
are examples of code to speech. They are
[supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) trained
neural networks and require lots of data, 20-50 million translations to
get accurate speech. Five years ago this was improbable.

The [Deep Neural
Networks](https://deeplearning4j.org/neuralnet-overview) used are
[encoder-decoder
networks](https://www.quora.com/What-are-encoder-decoder-models-in-recurrent-neural-networks)
to build something similar to
[Babelfish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuumnjJWFO4) from
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The encoder takes words over a time
period. The decoder is a neural network to return the answer to the
question or the translation.

The questions to now answer are:

1.  What weights are given to each word in sentence?

2.  What weights are given to the most important words? These questions
    are asking whether the the word in terms of context or the word in
    terms of relaying an emotion should have a higher weight, and how is
    this decided.

Memory and [memory
differentiation](https://deepmind.com/blog/differentiable-neural-computers/)
can be used to remember the previous word and what comes next from the
memory in the network. These deep neural networks are difficult owing to
the number of parameters. Speech to text has 50 million parameters and
language to text 40-100 million parameters. This requires
high-performance GPU computing.

# Considerations for Multi GPU Deep Learning Model Training, [Jonas Lööf](https://twitter.com/nvidia), [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.co.uk/page/home.html)

Complex neural networks have more parameters. [Google
translation](https://translate.google.co.uk/), for example, uses 8700
million parameters and 100
[ExaFlops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exascale_computing) Therefore,
they use multiple GPUs for training. The best practice for multiple GPUs
is to optimize for 1 GPU first.

Hardware: [NVLinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVLink) for fast
communication, DJX1 for scaling and performance. Software: Frameworks
([Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) etc), Environments
([NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.co.uk/page/home.html))

For Frameworks, [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) has built in
multiple GPUs and is easy to configure, [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)
has high-level interface for parallelisation across multiple GPUs but
the most suitable framework for multiple GPUs is
[MxNet](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/) which is as flexible as
Tensorflow but still has parallelisation across multiple GPUs.

# Representations for Deep Learning, [Marta Garnelo](https://twitter.com/deepmindai), [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/)

[Constrained
Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_conditional_model) are
used to get good representations of the data. The most popular types of
models are [Reinforcement
Learning](https://deepmind.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning/) and
[Object Oriented
Learning](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=544417&dl=ACM&coll=DL&CFID=990329573&CFTOKEN=56346616).
Individually these are not very efficient, need a high level cognition,
and neutral networks are in essence black boxes, so it is hard to know
what is happening inside them.

# Word Embeddings in Search, [Fabrizio Silvestri](https://twitter.com/fabreetseo) , [Facebook](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research-fair/)

Search uses [One-Hot
encoding](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-one-hot-encoding-why-and-when-do-you-have-to-use-it-e3c6186d008f),
translating the word to a vector that can be input into a deep neural
network. In search sessions, we extract info and use them to build the
representation

# Towards Teaching Machines to Read and Reason, [Sebastian Riedel](https://twitter.com/riedelcastro), UCL / [Bloomsbury.ai](http://bloomsbury.ai/)

The purpose of the neural network is to read a document and answer
questions about the text. The same model can read both [structured
models](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/structured_data.html) and
[semi-structured
models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-structured_model). It is also
able to extract information from the paragraph to do simple maths and
also follow links within the paragraph to find the right answer.

The neural network has [end-to-end
differentiation](https://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/~gpavlou/Publications/Journal-papers/Boucad-07.pdf)
readers and program interpreters. As the neural network only has
downstream annotation, it is not expensive to run, the learnt models are
interpretable and you can allow injection of prior knowledge into the
neural network to make it that much more accurate.

# Labelling Topics Using Neural Networks, [Nikolaos Aletras](https://twitter.com/nikaletras), [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/)

Topic models are used to label the training data set. A neural network
can learn a set of topics. Document topic allocations have [multinomial
distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution)
with a probability of each occurring. The label types can be text or
images. To evaluate, there is either an average rating that is
human-assigned which the neural network has to try and replicate, or
[Normalised Discounted Cumulative
Gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain).

# Opinion Mining Using Heterogeneous Online Data, [Elena Kochkina](https://twitter.com/elena_kochkina), [University of Warwick](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/systemsbiology/research/researchareas/datascience/)

In this talk they used a trained neural network on social media to see
how rumours spread online quickly, through
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en). We can classify a user's stance
on a rumour using a stance classifier. A user can either support, deny,
question or comment on a rumour, and scepticism towards a rumour implies
it is fake. There is a conservation structure in verification of the
rumour: the output. The neural network can also do sentiment analysis,
identifying the emotions of document which can be positive, negative or
neutral. The neural network can discover the sentiment towards the
target of a sentence. Heterogeneous data from mobile phones - such as
social media, messages, mobile data and calls - can serve well-being.

# Applications of DL: Anomaly Detection, Sentiment Classification, & Over-sampling, [Noura Al Moubayed](https://twitter.com/NouraAlMoubayed), [Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/iarc/nvidiacuda/workshop/)

A deep neural network can be used in anomaly detection for
cybersecurity, the cloud and social media. Tokenisation and topic
modeling is used for the unsupervised sorting of anomalies into topics.
Data is not abundant but the neural network is easy to train and it is
fast.

Sentiment classification is included where the neural network is trained
on positive statements only and then negative statements only.

If more samples are needed, the feedforward network generates samples
from prior samples and calculates new ones.
[Backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) is used
for optimization.

Application of this neural network are social robots to help autistic
children deal with uncertainty.

# One Perceptron to Rule Them All, [Xavier Giro-i-Nieto](https://twitter.com/DocXavi), [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://kemlg.upc.edu/en)

When we build neural networks, each layer uses a
[Perceptron](https://appliedgo.net/perceptron/).

A Perceptron-based neural network is used in [Language

# Iterative Approach To Improving Sample Generation, [Antonia Creswell](https://twitter.com/ToniCreswell), [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/machine-learning/)

For small intial data sets, models can synthesise new data samples by
augmenting the training data and imagining new concepts to better
understand data. There are two possible methods: [generative
autoencoding](http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/dambrosio_gecco08.pdf) and
[generative adversials
networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network)
We need at least 100k training samples that don't need to be labelled.

The neural network layout is the following: Image -\> Encoder -\>
Regularisation/Deep Net -\> Decoder -\> Image Variation

These types of neural networks are called [Generated Augmented
Network](http://www.rricard.me/machine/learning/generative/adversarial/networks/2017/04/05/gans-part1.html),
where a
[discriminator](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165027094901554)
can decide if the data has been generated or is real data.

# Discovering & Synthesizing Novel Concepts With Minimal Supervision, [Zeynep Akata](https://twitter.com/UvA_Amsterdam), [University of Amsterdam](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/)

A neural network that can produce [Side
Information](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-39624-6_15)
by adding attributes to class data, such as color, size or key
features, using [Zero shot
learning](https://www.quora.com/What-is-zero-shot-learning).

# Cooperative AI for Critical Application, [Fangde Liu](https://twitter.com/imperialcollege), [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/machine-learning/)

An AI has many applications in industries such as traffic, energy,
finance and healthcare. However AI in healthcare, right now, is like a
baby who needs to go to school. Autonomous surgery was shutdown by the
FDA after just one day. Currently
[TensorLab](https://www.tensorlab.net/) is doing AI vigilance.

# Artificial Intelligence for Space-Based Technology, [Luca Perletta](https://twitter.com/DigitalGlobe), [DigitalGlobe](https://www.digitalglobe.com/)

Satellites gather 70 terrabytes of data per day and put the data on the
Cloud. Deep learning is then used to extract information at scale. We
can understand global trends such as understanding where cars are parked
to inform plans on where to put a new car park. Data such as how many
cars are produced can be used by hedge funds to predict profits for car
manufacturers, oil production, where ships or planes are, continental
scale maps and flood-water classification.

A [deep core framework](http://deepcore.io/) is applied to the satellite
imagery.

With all the data, could an AI predict wealth from space?

[Digital Globe](https://www.digitalglobe.com/) is launching satellites
so they can have images of anywhere in the world, every 20 minutes.

# Towards Automatic Front-end Development With Deep Learning, [Tony Beltramelli](https://twitter.com/Tbeltramelli), [uizard.io](https://uizard.io/)

[UIzard's](https://uizard.io/) deep neural network changes human designs
to their own. They designed a domain-specific language which compiles to
HTML/CSS or XML etc. A pre-trained neural network recognizes any objects
(cars, trees, shapes) in the design. A
[Pix2Code](https://github.com/tonybeltramelli/pix2code) recurrent neural
network is used as it has the property of being end-to-end
differentiable, which has advantages with accuracy.

import dl12 from '../../assets/blog/dl-conf12.jpg'

<Image alt='image' src={dl12} />

The benefit of this model is that there is no manually-labelled data and
a limitless amount of sample data by taking screenshots of online
webpages

# Bayesian DL for Accurate Characterisation of Uncertainties in Time Series Analysis, [Christopher Bonnett](https://twitter.com/cbonnett), [alpha-i](https://alpha-i.co/)

Deep neural networks have limitations such as static information sets, a
model that doesn't know what it doesn't know and needing a lot of human
involvement to optimize.

[Bayesian Deep
Learning](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/building-a-bayesian-deep-learning-classifier-ece1845bc09)
has uncertainty on each end, i.e. the result is uncertainty. Outside the
range of training data, a Bayesian deep learning neural network gives
uncertain results and effectively says \"I don't know. Get more data
here\". This gives a very risk-averse neural network. However, it comes
with more computational overhead.

# Using Deep Learning to Understand the Meaning of Content, [Antoine Amann](https://twitter.com/AntoineAmann), [Echobox](https://www.echobox.com/)

At [EchoBox](https://www.echobox.com/) they are using AI to
auto-generate content (the image and relevant text) on social media, at
the correct time. It is used by the Guardian and New Scientist to
generate tweets or Facebook messages to promote their articles. Their
deep learning neural networks also predict the virality of the articles.

The neural network understands the meaning of content of the article and
the audiences that read them. Therefore, each client has their own model
based on the articles they write.

They used data from who was reading what articles to predict elections.
They correctly predicted French elections through both rounds,
minute-by-minute, based on which articles people were looking at in
France. They are currently doing the same with the [German
election](http://www.echoboxbarometer.com/?de).

# AI that can Compose Original Music, [Ed Newton-Rex](https://twitter.com/ednewtonrex) , [Jukedeck](https://www.jukedeck.com/)

An AI that uses deep neural network over [rule-based
systems](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6795599/), [markov
chains](https://www.r-bloggers.com/is-deep-learning-a-markov-chain-in-disguise/),
[evolutionary
algorithms](https://blog.coast.ai/lets-evolve-a-neural-network-with-a-genetic-algorithm-code-included-8809bece164),
which are viable alternatives is
[Midi](http://www.hexahedria.com/2015/08/03/composing-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/),
which trains on notes and chords to produce new music.

You can try it [here](https://www.jukedeck.com/) to create your own
piece of music with deep learning, (navigate to \"Make\" through the
link).

# End-to-End Deep Learning for Detection, Prevention, & Classification of Cyber Attacks, [Eli David](https://twitter.com/DrEliDavid), [Deep Instinct](https://www.deepinstinct.com/)

Currently, most new malware is simply old malware that has been slightly
altered to become undetectable. In this instance, cybersecurity is a
reactive rather than a proactive industry.

Raw data is converted into linear features and input in the supervised
deep neural network as raw binary values. Conventional methods are not
reliable due to large data sets and complex data.

The neural network works on both mobiles and endpoints - computers. A
trained neural network goes onto the device and scans new files. It is
also connectionless and only has to be updated every three to four
months as the deep neural network is trained on mutated malware. This
means it knows how to handle malware that it has never seen before.

You could argue that this neural network can be used to create new
malware.

# The Quest for Understanding Real World With Synthetic Data, [Ankur Handa](https://twitter.com/ankurhandos), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)

A 3D model is built through a connected camera. However, it cannot
recognize the individual objects in the real work. What the neural
network really wants is a labelled 3D scene. Geometric data, such as
depth, height and the angle of gravity, and graphical data such as
color (RGB) is collected.

Therefore, we have automatic interior design generation under
constraints eg.. no table between sofa and TV.

# Memory & Rapid Adaption in Generative Models, [Jörg Bornschein](https://twitter.com/DeepMindAI), [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/)

Supervised tasks have high-dimensional inputs but low-dimensional
outputs

There are three approaches for better outputs:

1.  [Autoregressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model):
    generate 1 pixel at a time

2.  [Adversarial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversary_model): Noise
    -\> generator neural network -\> discriminator (decides real or
    fake) Want to fool discriminator. Discriminator trained to find real
    image

3.  [Direct Latent
    Variable](http://pages.ucsd.edu/~aronatas/Latent%20Variable%20Analysis.pdf):
    Decode random noise to observed data

Additonally there is [Memory
Augmentation](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/santoro16.pdf), where the
memory contains examples from the training set.

# What Would it Take to Train an Agent to Play with a Shape-Sorter?, [Feryal Behbahani](https://twitter.com/imperialcollege) , [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/machine-learning/)

To train, [Deep Reinforcement
Learning](https://deepmind.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning/) is
used. The observation is passed into the neural network to produce an
output. The environment for the test is a simulator of an arm putting
objects in the correct places. The agent is the deep neural network
collecting observations from the simulator.

The training is done by an [Asynchronous Advantage
Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf). The actor being the
neural network which moves arm in the simulation. The critic sees the
results and judges the value.

Possible solutions to this problem are learning with auxiliary
information (e.g. depth), separate learning vision from control or learn
from demonstrations, which is supervised learning.

# Artificial Intelligence Driving the Future of Connected Cars, [Maggie Mhanna](https://twitter.com/Groupe_Renault), [Renault Digital](http://www.autonews.com/article/20161018/OEM06/161019861/renault-nissan-creates-tech-division-to-accelerate-mobility-push)

AI can be used in the prediction of battery performance in electric
cars. AI can detect driving data such as mileage, charge, voltage and
warranty. It could also predict future failure of the battery.

# Balance, Bias & Size: Unlocking the Potential of Retrospective Clinical Data for Healthcare Applications, [Timor Kadir](https://twitter.com/Optellum1), [Optellum](http://www.optellum.com/)

An AI can be used to look at pictures of lungs for lung cancer
management. However, if there is a bias in the retrospective data sets
then it affects the accuracy of the neural network.

The machine learning system is trained on medical images. It takes the
image, puts it through the machine learning network and applies
regression with the output being a risk score.

# Drug Discovery Disrupted: Quantum Physics Meets Machine Learning, [Noor Shaker](https://twitter.com/noorshak), [GTN](http://gtn.ai/)

[Schrodinger's
Equation](http://clean.energyscience.ca/publications/032.html) is used
to apply machine learning systems on physical systems. In quantum
mechanics, states relate to vectors which can then be input into the
machine learning system.
