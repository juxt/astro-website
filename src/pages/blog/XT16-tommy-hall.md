Tom Hall is a good friend of JUXT and active member of London's Clojure
community, an original thinker, researcher and sharer.

One of the recurring themes of XT16 was personal stories of journeys of
exploration, and Tom shares his journey into Unlimited Register
Machines.

Can computer programs be represented mathematically, as numbers? And if
so, how could you create a machine to execute them?

Tom begins by demonstrating how a few simple rules can be combined to
form addition, then multiplication and on towards encoding programs as
numbers.

He then expands on these ideas to building an instruction set for a
simple computer to execute these programs.

This completes our XT16 talks about composition - from simple
mathematical rules to create assembly instructions described here, [from
assembly to functional programming
languages](/blog/posts/XT16-hakan-raberg-the-search-for-simplicity.html),
from functional programming to [generated 3D
