The [XT24 Fintech Conference](https://www.juxt.pro/xt24/), hosted by JUXT in Milton Keynes earlier this year, was a full-day event featuring talks and fireside chats with notable engineering leaders and tech innovators at the forefront of banking, fintech, and hedge funds.

[Oliver Hine](https://github.com/oliyh)'s talk focused on the importance of defining a schema for your data model. JSON, having emerged as a dominant plain-text data format due to its simplicity and versatility, was central to his presentation. Hine highlighted JSON schema as a powerful tool for declaring data models, allowing the specification of types and constraints, thus ensuring data consistency and integrity across various applications and services.

A well-defined JSON schema brings a multitude of advantages. It facilitates the auto-generation of rich user interfaces and establishes clear contracts between services. These benefits streamline development processes, enhance interoperability, and contribute to the creation of more robust and maintainable systems. Hine's layered approach effectively conveyed the significance of JSON schema in modern data modeling, making his talk a significant highlight of the XT24 conference.
