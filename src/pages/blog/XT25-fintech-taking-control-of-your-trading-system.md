At the [XT25 Fintech Conference](https://www.juxt.pro/xt25/), Peter Windle, Distinguished Engineer and Managing Director at [HSBC](https://www.hsbc.com), delivered an insightful talk titled 'Taking Control of Your Trading System'.

In this session, Peter walked the audience through HSBC’s journey of replacing a legacy vendor monolith with an in-house built system designed to support real-time trade capture, risk, and reporting for their Global FX business.

He shared hard-earned lessons on how to:

- Transition from vendor lock-in to internal control without disruption

- Design a robust trade repository as the foundation for risk and reporting

- Leverage Datomic and Clojure to build a high-fidelity, temporal data store

- Apply architectural patterns like the Strangler Pattern, timesharding, and decanting to evolve complex systems incrementally

- Tackle real challenges like event stream syncing, performance at scale, and query responsiveness

With millions of trades flowing through the system daily, Peter’s team prioritised reliability, data integrity, and operational resilience, all while enabling faster iteration and better alignment with the business.
