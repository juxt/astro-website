# My Journey Through Emacs, Vim, and Cursor: From Old-School Badass to AI-Assisted Developer

Like many developers, I didn’t commit to my first text editor. I experimented, switched, broke things, and eventually ended up somewhere unexpected. My journey took me through Emacs, Vim, and now Cursor, each with its own unique way of making me question my career choices.

This isn’t a guide or a debate about which editor is "best." It’s simply my experience navigating some of the most opinionated tools in software development.

Some people stick with whatever their IDE throws at them. Others spend decades refining their perfect editor setup, tweaking every keybinding until they reach a state of nirvana (or carpal tunnel).

I’m somewhere in the middle.

## Emacs: The Infinite Abyss of Customization

When I was just a bright-eyed, unsuspecting junior developer, my husband convinced me that Emacs was the best choice.

So I installed Emacs, a choice that instantly aged me by about 30 years.

Emacs is not just a text editor. It’s a lifestyle. A text-based operating system. A way of life where you can edit code, check your email, browse the web, and probably even run a small country - all without leaving Emacs.

I spent more time tweaking keybindings and reading documentation than actually writing code. But I stuck with it. I liked its REPL-driven workflow, the power of Lisp scripting, and most of all, the smug satisfaction of knowing I was using something mere mortals couldn’t comprehend.

Sitting there in Emacs, typing away with my arcane keybindings and Lisp-powered automations, I imagined myself looking down on the mere mortals using VS Code.

They had colorful icons, clicky buttons, and AI autocomplete, meanwhile I was in a pure text-based world, bending my editor to my will.

Sure, it took me five minutes to remember how to save a file, but wasn’t that the price of greatness?

### The Reality of Emacs  

After the initial excitement wore off, I started noticing the flaws.

- **The keybindings were relentless.** Everything relied on Ctrl and Alt, and my hands started to protest.
- **Accidentally closing it was a nightmare.** Restarting Emacs with all my settings intact required a degree in Emacsology.
- **The learning never stopped.** No matter how much I customized, there was always one more thing to tweak.

I had spent days configuring an editor instead of writing code. It was powerful, but was it worth the effort?

**Final Verdict:** Emacs is powerful, but it felt like building a spaceship when all I needed was a bicycle. I respect it. I fear it. But I moved on.

## Vim: The Speed Demon That Hates You

At this point, my senior colleague intervened. “Forget Emacs. Vim is the best.”

I trusted him. He set up my config, showed me the basics, and assured me that this was the only editor I’d ever need.

Then reality hit.

Vim had modes. Vim had cryptic commands. Vim had an entire community speaking in riddles like `:q!` and `ggVG`.

And yet…

The power was undeniable.

No more Ctrl + Alt gymnastics. I was moving through my code at blazing speed. I started to feel like a true hacker, flying through files without ever touching the mouse.

And yes, I was still looking down on VS Code users.

> *“Pfft. Try exiting Vim without Googling it first, then we’ll talk.”*

Little did I know, that’s exactly what most people do. One quick search, and you’ll find that “how to exit Vim” is one of the most Googled programming questions of all time.

It turns out, my struggle was part of a long and painful tradition.

#### The Moment of Fear  

For weeks, my Emacs muscle memory refused to let go.

I would instinctively press **Ctrl + X, Ctrl + S** to save… and then immediately freeze.

Would my file save? Would Vim close? Would my terminal catch fire?

I didn’t know. I just sat there, waiting. Praying. Hoping I hadn’t deleted my entire file.

Despite my Emacs muscle memory sabotaging me, I started to love Vim.

- **It was fast.** No mouse, no distractions (just pure efficiency).
- **Modal editing made sense.** Separating normal and insert mode felt natural after a while.
- **It ran everywhere.** No matter what machine I was on, Vim was always there.

I had survived the Vim learning curve.

And then, I made a huge mistake.

### I Tried to Update Vim.  

Something broke.

Plugins disappeared. Keybindings stopped working. Vim refused to launch.

I spent days trying to fix it (reading obscure forum posts, running mysterious terminal commands, breaking things even more before fixing them).

By the time I got it working again, I had:

- Deleted my entire config file twice.
- Reinstalled Vim at least four times.
- Questioned all my life choices.

Vim was great… but I started wondering if there was an easier way.

**Final Verdict:** Vim is a dream if you’re willing to suffer through the initiation ritual. It’s the *Dark Souls* of text editors, brutal at first, rewarding once mastered.

## Cursor: The Editor I Chose for Myself  

After my Emacs and Vim adventures, I stumbled upon Cursor, an AI-powered editor that promised to make my life easier.

Instead of spending hours memorizing commands, I could just… ask it to do things.  
Instead of searching Stack Overflow, I could just… ask the AI.

It was modern, intelligent, and (most shockingly) required no configuration.

But this time, I didn’t ask for advice.

I had spent too long listening to other people:

- My husband (Emacs evangelist).
- My senior colleague (Vim warrior).
- The internet (split between "Emacs for life" and "Vim is the only way").

And what I found was that Cursor simply worked.

- Unlike Emacs, I didn’t have to spend weeks tweaking it.
- Unlike Vim, I didn’t have to rewire my brain to use it.
- It just worked.

But then, Cursor asked me a very important question:

> **“Do you want to use Vim keybindings or Emacs keybindings?”**

This was a serious dilemma. My Emacs experience had shaped how I worked, but Vim’s modal editing had finally clicked.

In the end, Vim’s two modes helped me decide.

So, I chose Vim keybindings.

At first, Cursor felt like the perfect editor. AI assistance? Autocomplete? No config nightmares?

But then, it happened.

One day, I asked Cursor to help me refactor some TypeScript.

It confidently suggested a function that did not work at all.

I debugged. I researched. I rewrote the function.

Only later did I realize that I had spent an hour fixing AI-generated nonsense instead of writing my own mistakes.

Had I simply been tricked into a different kind of suffering?

Maybe I wasn’t fighting my editor anymore, but now I was fighting the AI itself, arguing with a machine that was way too confident in its own wrong answers.

At least with Emacs and Vim, I always knew who to blame.

Instead of wrestling with keybindings, I was now battling overconfident AI suggestions. Progress, I guess?

But one thing is certain: I still know how to quit Vim.

And that has to count for something 😊.
