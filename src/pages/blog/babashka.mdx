At JUXT, we try to reduce the number of tools we use to the bare
minimum.

The fewer tools we need to learn to do our work, the more time we can
devote to learning each tool well.

Our standard operating system is GNU/Linux ([Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)), which we use on both developer
laptops and servers. Our standard document format is AsciiDoc (of the
[Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/) variety). All our documents
(contracts, client reports, web pages, blog articles, policy documents,
etc.) are stored in AsciiDoc and we generate HTML and/or PDF from these.
Adding in git and [keybase](https://keybase.io), we've pieced together a
capable company document production, approval and management system.

## Building document PDFs with `make` and `asciidoctor-pdf`

Sometimes, a document might require some custom build logic. For
example, a report might contain a table of data extracted from a Crux
database. Naturally we use [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and bash to knit together
these customised builds, but whenever you try to do something complex,
you can end up thrashing around in the long grass.

For example, we have a document named `ETH001.adoc` which includes an
image stored as `ETH001/boy-and-computer.jpg`. The PDF version of the
document can be generated using a Make rule:

```bash
target/pdf/%.pdf: %.adoc brand/juxt-theme.yml
   asciidoctor-pdf -r asciidoctor-diagram -o $@ $<
```

This means that a change to the original Asciidoc source file, or a
change to the theme we use to build the PDFs, will result in the
`asciidoctor-pdf` executable being run and the resulting PDF rebuilt.

However, since the PDF also contains images, if those images change
(sometimes we're in the process of enhancing images in Gimp), we want
the PDF to be rebuilt. But how is it possible to let Make know about
these dependencies?

Well, we could go through the source file and look for any `image::`
tags. Here's one:

```bash
image::ETH001/boy-and-computer.jpg[width=300pt]
```

Then we can add an additional dependency rule inside the Makefile:

```bash
target/pdf/ETH001.pdf: ETH001/boy-and-computer.jpg
```

Maintaining these rules might be a pain, and we'll quickly forget to do
it. My `sed` and `awk` skills might be up to the tasks of grep'ing out
the `include::` lines of each file, but ... I'd much rather be using
Clojure. I'm always struck by the startling contrast between the
consistency and elegance of the Unix line-by-line data processing model
and the inconsistency and ugliness of the syntax of the individual
tools. This is what makes Lisps such as Clojure all the more
extraordinary - an easy-to-learn, consistent syntax which can scale up
to the tackle the most ambitious of problems.

Until now, I probably wouldn't bother writing a Clojure program for this
task. Clojure is a little too slow to start up to be suitable for
scripting.

## Enter Babashka!

[Babashka](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka) is a Clojure-like
scripting language written by \@borkdude (Michiel Borkent), of
`clj-kondo` fame. Babashka is [close enough](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka#differences-with-clojure)
to Clojure so I can avoid having to clutter my memory with the myriad of
different syntaxes of Unix tools (bash, sed, awk, grep). I can leverage
my Clojure familiarity for the boring task of writing scripts.

So let's write a script (`depend_images.clj`) that will go through our
50 odd AsciiDoc files, extract out each line that brings in an image,
and print a Make dependency rule between the document and that image:

```clojure
(doseq
  [adoc (.listFiles (java.io.File. "."))
   :when (.isFile adoc)
   :let [[_ basename] (re-matches #"(.*).adoc" (.getName adoc))]
   :when basename
   line (line-seq (io/reader adoc))
   :let [[_ match] (re-matches #"image::(.*)\[.*\]" line)]
   :when match]
  (println
   (format "target/pdf/%s.pdf: %s" basename match)))
```

In our `Makefile` we can add a `depend` target that will run this
script:

```shell
depend:
        bb depend_images.clj > images.mk
```

We can run the target with `make`:

```shell
$ make depend
```

On my machine, that takes about 170ms. That's perfectly acceptable for
my use-case.

The resulting file (`images.mk`) can be included in the `Makefile` with
the following:

```bash
include images.mk
```

That's it.

<Image alt='image' src={winking} />

"Remember, learn Lisp and use it everywhere. Everything else is mind
clutter."

## Epilogue

I'm looking forward to reaching for `babashka` at times where I'd
normally reach for `bash` (or `awk`, or `sed`). Of course, there are
plenty of alternative solutions to these simple problems. However, it's
a tribute to the design of Clojure that the language feels so naturally
consistent, and can achieve similar feats to a compendium of Unix tools,
each with their own syntactic idiosyncrasies.

For many many years, I've wished for a Clojure-like replacement for
classic shell-scripting. This may just be it.
