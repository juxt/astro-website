Welcome to **Write Go Fast** — a pragmatic guide to Go programming when time is your scarcest resource.

## The Reality Check

With enough time, anyone can write beautiful, idiomatic Go code. But what happens when you're building a quick proof-of-concept? Racing toward a fast-approaching deadline? Prototyping under pressure?

That's when you need to write **good enough** code that adapts well later. Code that gets the job done without painting you into architectural corners. Code that's pragmatic first, perfect second.

## The Foundation Series: Complete

You've just finished the Foundation series — the essential, non-negotiable basics for productive Go. These chapters covered:
- Finding the Familiar
- Unlearning the Familiar
- Language Traps
- Data Structures
- Day-One Habits
- Project Structure & Composition
- Handy Function Patterns
- Performance-Aware Coding

If you've worked through these, you're ready to build Go projects that ship fast and adapt even faster.

## What's Next: Write Go Fast — Assume Everything You Have Written, Or It Will

The next phase is all about **living with your code**. Assume every line you write will be used, reused, and abused — by you, your team, and maybe the world. The sequel dives into:
- Patterns for rapid iteration and safe change
- Strategies for code that survives deadlines, pivots, and scale
- How to build for the future without slowing down today

Stay tuned for "Write Go Fast — Assume Everything You Have Written, Or It Will Be." This is where Go gets real.

## Let's Start Building

Ready to write Go that ships? Start with [Part 1: Finding the Familiar](./part-1-finding-the-familiar) and learn to leverage what you already know.

Time to build something that works — and works well.
