I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what separates a good engineer from a great one. It isn’t just technical mastery. The systems we build, the products we ship, the solutions that actually stick, they are all shaped by the way we interact with the people around us.

In this talk, I focus on soft skills as an essential part of delivering great systems for clients. Not as an optional add-on, but as something that matters every day. Whether it’s navigating a difficult conversation with a colleague, bringing clarity to a stakeholder meeting, or just listening with genuine curiosity, the way we show up has real impact.

I highlight five areas that have consistently helped me get the most out of interactions. These aren’t abstract leadership bullet points. They are lessons I’ve learned by being in the room, by missing opportunities, and by intentionally improving over time.

Something that surprised many people when I started talking about it was how much I enjoy being involved in recruitment. Helping to spot and attract talented engineers isn’t just about scaling a team. It’s a chance to practise empathy, to ask better questions, to reflect on how we communicate what we value. Every interview becomes another way to sharpen the very skills we want to see in our teams.

Soft skills matter because software is ultimately a human endeavour. Paying attention to how we collaborate makes our work better and our teams stronger.
