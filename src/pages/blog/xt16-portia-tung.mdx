Portia and I used to work together with Exoftware in the noughties,
training and consulting in
[XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming). Those years
were very educational for me, working in lots of companies, mostly
trying to contribute to solving difficult problems in big teams and
code-bases. It was far from an easy role.

But the best thing about the company was the regular offsites where we
all came together to share stories, and that's when I got to see
first-hand Portia's skill of looking at problems a different way, often
perceiving the human aspects behind the seemingly intractable technical
or organizational issues. As Jon is fond of reminding us, software is,
ultimately, [a people
problem](http://www.lovebusinessbooks.com/2009/03/the-secrets-of-consulting-by-gerald-m-weinberg/).

I bumped into Portia at the station on the way down to London from
Milton Keynes and we were able spend the train journey catching up, and
she told me of her role as a playmaker. We discussed how computer
programming, as a series of fun and addictive puzzle-solving activities,
is a form of play. But Portia explained how it went much further than
that...

From the very beginning you'll see Portia's unique style, involving all
of us in her talk. I hope you enjoy it and if you have any comments, use
