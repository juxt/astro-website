In order to prevent [xt-play](https://play.xtdb.com) from having downtime due
to [traffic spikes](https://www.atomic14.com/2022/12/15/the-hacker-news-effect.html),
I converted the backend to run on AWS Lambda (previously it was running on AWS
ECS with Fargate). While doing so I had a bunch of trouble so I wanted to write
down what worked for me. Hopefully it can help you out too!

A quick note on my constraints: `xt-play` works by spinning up a fresh [XTDB](https://xtdb.com)
node for each request. This meant that I needed the lambda to run on the plain
old JVM. No ClojureScript for me! As it happened this was quite quick to get
started with (once I figured out what functions to put where).



## Creating our jar

Let's start by making a sample project:

```sh
$ mkdir -p sample-lambda/src/
$ cd sample-lambda
```

Next let's add our dependencies, I'll be using `deps.edn` but feel free to use
whatever build tooling you like:
```clojure
{:paths ["src"]
 :deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.11.1"}
        com.amazonaws/aws-lambda-java-core {:mvn/version "1.2.3"}}
 :aliases
 {:build {:extra-deps {io.github.clojure/tools.build {:git/tag "v0.8.4" :git/sha "8c3cd69"}}
          :ns-default build}}}
```

The important one is [`aws-lambda-java-core`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.amazonaws/aws-lambda-java-core)
which provides the interface we need to implement in our `src/lambda.clj`:
```clojure
(ns lambda
  (:gen-class
   :implements [com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.RequestStreamHandler]))

(defn -handleRequest [_ is os _context]
  (let [input (slurp is)]
    (if (re-find #"error" input)
      (throw (ex-info "test" {:my "error"}))
      (spit os "test"))))
```

Here I'm reading the input as a string using `slurp`, but elsewhere I've had
success reading JSON using [cheshire's](https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire)
`parse-stream` and [muuntaja's](https://github.com/metosin/muuntaja) `decode`.

The Lambda [Java runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-java.html)
requires a jar so let's build one with `tools.build`:
```clojure
(ns build
  (:require [clojure.tools.build.api :as b]))

(def lib 'my/lambda)
(def version (format "0.1.%s" (b/git-count-revs nil)))
(def class-dir "target/classes")
(def basis (delay (b/create-basis {:project "deps.edn"})))
(def uber-file (format "target/%s-%s-standalone.jar" (name lib) version))

(defn clean [_]
  (b/delete {:path "target"}))

(defn uber [_]
  (b/copy-dir {:src-dirs ["src" "resources"]
               :target-dir class-dir})
  (b/compile-clj {:basis @basis
                  :src-dirs ["src"]
                  :class-dir class-dir})
  (b/uber {:class-dir class-dir
           :uber-file uber-file
           :basis @basis}))
```

Now we can build a jar with `clj -T:build uber`:

```sh
$ clj -T:build uber
$ ls target
classes
lambda-0.1.1-standalone.jar
```

Finally with our jar in hand it's a easy as following [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/java-package.html#java-package-console)
to create your new Lambda!

All of this code can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/juxt/plain-clojure-lambda).



## Bonus: A full-stack application in a lambda

For `xt-play` I wanted the deployment to be as simple as possible, and what could
be simpler than a webserver serving a static frontend with some api routes?

I've got a demo repo [here](https://github.com/juxt/plain-clojure-lambda/tree/reitit-function-url),
or you can look at the (much messier) [`xt-play` source](https://github.com/xtdb/xt-fiddle/tree/4257436e744838c714be33c28ec053875e3fae83).

As an overview, I:
- Moved the clojure source to `src/clj`
- Added `reitit` and `muuntaja` as dependencies
- Added `resources` to the paths (took me too long to figure out!)
- Created some conversion functions between what function URL's want and what `ring` wants ([this post](https://sideshowcoder.com/2018/05/11/clojure-ring-api-gateway-lambda/) was super helpful!)
- Added a `src/clj/handler.clj` namespace with my `reitit` routes
- Created a `shadow-cljs` project that builds to `resources/public/js/` w/ associated `package.json`
- Told `build.clj` to build my `shadow-cljs` project when a jar is built

Phew, but with that we're done!
Just upload your new jar and [create a function url](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/urls-configuration.html#create-url-console)
then any requests to it will go through to the `reitit` handler.

As a bonus bonus: you can even develop against a local webserver using `user/go!`.



## A note on performance

Performance wise, you'll probably find the above fine for a lot of use cases,
but if you're finding cold start times too high there are some options:

[SnapStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html)
is a completely free way to improve your cold starts, all you need to do is
[configure it and publish a version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart-activate.html)
and they'll auto-magically be faster!

Another option (that works with SnapStart!) is to increase the CPU power of the
Lambda which is done by [increasing the memory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/operatorguide/computing-power.html).
Even though it's more expensive per GB-second, because having more CPU means
that your Lambda can execute quicker, the cost can even out. There's an
excellent tool called [AWS Lambda Power Tuning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/operatorguide/profile-functions.html)
which can help automate the process of selecting the right amount of memory.

Here's the output for xt-play's cold starts:

import cold from '../../assets/blog/plain-clojure-cold.png'

<a target="_blank" href="https://lambda-power-tuning.show/#AAEAAgAEAAYACMAL;AKCARQCA00QA4IxEAMCIRAAAJUQAwGpE;+wORN4NzbjeZ0543jEPnN5kGujfSXEI4">
  <Image alt='As memory increases, invocation time goes down and cost goes up. The graphs meet at roughly 1024MB.' src={cold} />
</a>

It's slightly inaccurate because each configuration is only executed once, but
there's a [PR to do this properly](https://github.com/alexcasalboni/aws-lambda-power-tuning/pull/206)
which looks like it'll be done soon.

And here's the output for warm starts (I set it to 100 invocations each):

import warm from '../../assets/blog/plain-clojure-warm.png'

<a target="_blank" href="https://lambda-power-tuning.show/#AAEAAgAEAAYACMAL;AABAQImIWEBVVWVAAABQQHd3V0C8u1tA;Y3dYMpdPEDOXT5AzY3fYM5dPEDTm9FM0">
  <Image alt='As memory increases, invocation time stays the same and cost goes up.' src={warm} />
</a>

So it looks like (for xt-play) more memory/CPU won't give us more performance
once the Lambda's warm, but it will improve our cold start time.

I found this was enough for xt-play, but AWS has some [other recommendations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/operatorguide/perf-optimize.html)
that might be useful. And if you don't require a JVM you can always:
- [Use nbb](https://www.juxt.pro/blog/nbb-lambda/)
- [Use CloureScript on Nodejs](http://www.cesarolea.com/posts/writing-aws-lambdas-with-shadow-cljs/)
- [Use holy-lambda](https://github.com/FieryCod/holy-lambda)
- [Use your own native image](https://github.com/cnuernber/cljs-lambda-gateway-example)

Happy hacking!
