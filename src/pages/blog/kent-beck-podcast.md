In our latest JUXT Cast we invited <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck' target='_blank'>Kent Beck</a>, author of the original XP book, <a href='https://www.amazon.co.uk/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658' target='_blank'> Extreme Programming <br> Explained</a>.

Today, you might sub-title this book as 'Agile, the good parts', since XP introduced many of the practices that developers still value, such as Test Driven Development, Continuous Integration and Pair Programming.

Development isn't just about coding to a strict specification, and Agile did away with that perception. But there is still a strong sense that developers follow a linear path, working through the backlog of end-user requirements to implementation. Yet, Kent argues that wasn't what XP was about at all!

The essence XP is to introduce much faster feedback loops into the development process in order to allow a developer to search more rapidly through the vast set of possible solutions to the problem at hand. Many solutions ought to be tried and rejected in the search for better ones.

The idea of throwing away 'work' is at odds with the the prevailing accounting-based business view of software development. This approach leads to better, simpler solutions, which keep code-bases clean and flexible, able to take on further change.

Programmers who use interactive languages in their daily work, perhaps using a REPL, take for granted the advantages of being able to trial and reject numerous ideas as quickly as possible. It's second-nature to us. But many programmers still have to wait minutes for confirmation for even trivial experiments.

Happy listening!
