Has Clojure crossed the Chasm? Is the technology adoption curve even
applicable to a general purpose programming language?

The chasm is where many beautiful new technology products will waste
away. We have many examples of new languages that have been picked up
early on by innovators and propelled to some degree by early adopters,
but only a small selection will penetrate into what we could consider to
be mainstream usage.

Many languages will simple fade away whilst a few will become _zombie
languages_, forever propped up by a resolute group of benevolent
benefactors. The chasm is difficult to cross and it isn't forgiving.

In this post I'll take a tour through the curve, giving a subjective
view of where I think Clojure is.

# Not a level playing field

First though, what allows some languages to get ahead on the curve ahead
of others?

Those of us entrenched in the industry would acknowledge that Clojure
isn't as widely adopted as other languages created around the same time,
an example being Scala which is a
[Java.next](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-jn16/index.html)
sibling. Of course many would argue that this is testament to the
superiority of Scala as a language, but others may wish to scratch a
little deeper.

Clojure, to a higher degree than some other languages, represents
_Discontinuous Innovation_. In Clojure we can't carry our Object
Oriented idioms across with us and instead we are required to relearn
how to code, to change paradigm. To stare at a screen full of code and
to admit we have trouble understanding how it works, requires an
substantial degree of humility.

We have to deal with the jarring break in aesthetics that S-expressions
and all their parens will bring us. Writing code in S-expression trees
feels almost childlike in its restrained building blocks approach,
despite the obvious power of code becoming data.

Scala is more of a seamless programming upgrade for practitioners of
long established mainstream languages. Clojure, despite being a simpler
and more concise programming language, will have a harder curve to
climb.

Let's look at the curve.

# Innovators

It's easy to see how Clojure originally got started on the curve. It's a
Lisp on the JVM, and so a pent up wave of frustrated demand from Lispers
was immediately unleashed, who could now enjoy their way of programming
on a hugely adopted and battle hardened run-time environment.

Clojure is also well thought out with its stance on immutability and
persistent data collections, and so a wide range of technologists are
going to be drawn in through curiosity, especially when they hear good
things about it.

We see this happening. Community run Dojos regularly attract a large
amount of individuals who want to learn Clojure, and who practice it in
their own time outside of work. The online forums are full of people
helping each other to learn and get started, and to share information on
established and emerging libraries.

# Early Adopters

Early adopters are the _visionaries_ who can see Clojure being used as a
weapon to leapfrog the competition, where it can make an order of
magnitude's worth of improvement. Again we have observed this, where
individuals in positions of authority have driven Clojure adoption
forward. Companies building products such as Prismatic, Riemann,
CircleCI and service companies such as uSwitch in London are good
examples of this.

There are also early adopters where you might not expect them, for
example with some of the largest investment banks. Against a backdrop of
large-scale institutional inefficiency, technical visionaries are
looking for an approach that will yield a major increase in productivity
and systems quality. Inside large IT organizations there is the often
the budget and space to operate, and a healthy range of potential pilot
projects to choose from for trying something new.

# Early Majority and beyond

Then we hit the chasm, with the early majority being on the other side.

The early majority are _pragmatists_ who have a keener sense of risk.
They are motivated to adopt change because it's still early enough that
some of the visionary gains can be made, and they are also conscious of
the _flip-side_ risk of not moving with the times.

The pragmatists aren't so much looking to hear from the visionaries and
change agents, rather they want references from similar minded
pragmatists who will have endured a technology with the longer term in
mind. This is the Catch-22 situation and the rationale for the chasm;
there needs to be a bubbling critical mass of self-referencing early
adopters for a technical product to blast off and fly upwards the curve.

The [Cognitect blog](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2015/9/21/2-myths-and-2-facts-about-clojure-that-change-everything)
states _\'A quick scan of various job sites shows Clojure positions at
companies like Walmart, Facebook, Staples, Consumer Reports, Salesforce,
and Amazon. It doesn't get much more mainstream than that.\'_

This reveals that there are many well known companies now using Clojure,
but at the same time not all of them are shouting about it. For those
that want Clojure to be more mainstream (i.e. developers working for
large companies who would want to use Clojure), this aspect of low
profile adoption will frustrate. Exposure and case-studies is the oxygen
a new technology needs.

# Late Adopters and Laggards

Beyond the early majority we get the late majority, and then the
laggards.

As a rule of thumb as we progress through the curve the risk aversion of
the groups increases.

This isn't to say that Clojure doesn't have a relevant story to tell
here. Running on the JVM where Java developers can reuse their JAR
deployment, debugging and profiling skills, and with baked-in
immutability making for more predictable software, Clojure could be
considered a conservative option.

# Where is Clojure?

Doubtless there is a regional element to be considered, as Clojure
adoption is moving at different speeds in the world.

We could also break Clojure down and find that there are a group of
sub-technologies making their own journey, each following a potentially
different pathway. ClojureScript is one example that has the potential
to overtake its parent language on the curve by being applicable to a
wider variety of host environments.

From my European perspective, I think that Clojure is in the process of
currently crossing the chasm. We have our visionaries and large-scale
_flagship_ case-studies that will placate and excite the early majority,
but there is still some distance to travel before Clojure is commonplace
and can no longer regarded as niche.

It's an exciting time because innovators are still finding Clojure and
visionaries are still becoming inspired by it, and we are getting an
increasing number of high profile reference sites in the early majority.
A growing consensus is that the climb will be more gradual rather than
intensely short lived.

This isn't a bad thing as the growth will still be exponential, and
Clojure will have jumped the chasm.
