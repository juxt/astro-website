[World Singles Networks](https://worldsinglesnetworks.com/) is a dating and
singles community designed to help you make valuable connections with
people from all over the world. World Singles Networks was launched in
2001 and caters to numerous different ethnicities.

I met up with [Sean Corfield](http://corfield.org/), Senior Software Architect, to
chat about how they use Clojure at World Singles Networks and about his
experiences within the Clojure open source community.

**_Andrew: Could you give us a little background on World Singles
Networks?_**

**Sean:** The two founders had a vision to put together ethnic niche
dating, and it's one of those little companies that got started in the
traditional Silicon Valley way of two guys in their garage. One of the
founders essentially taught himself programming to build the first
version of the platform and it grew from there into lot of different
brands, ending up with something close to 100 different dating sites.

**_Andrew: How did you get started at World Singles Networks?_**

**Sean:** The dating business is fairly competitive. In 2009 World
Singles Networks decided to build the next generation version of the
platform and move towards a modern maintainable codebase. They brought
in a couple of my friends to rebuild the system and I got hired through
that. We went through a greenfield rewrite of the entire system, looking
at building the better next generation of dating sites. Now I have been
there longer than I have worked anywhere else in my life... which is
kind of fun.

## Tech history

**_Andrew: What's the tech story?_**

import sc from '../../assets/blog/scala-logo.png'

<Image alt='image' src={sc} />

**Sean:** When I got started, they were a ColdFusion shop and we picked
up frameworks and modern OO / MVC / DI frameworks to rebuild the system
as an extensible, customisable platform for that. In dating, you've got
the search engine which is core to what you work on. We had a process
that took changes in profiles - we have millions of members constantly
updating their profiles - and turned it into data that the search engine
could use. That needed to run 24/7.

Scala had XML literals, which is what the search engine needed, it had a
good concurrency story - or so I thought - and so I decided to build a
version of this process in Scala. It was back in the 2.7 days and we
went through the 2.8 migration, so there were binary compatibility
issues with every milestone build, where the entire build tool chain had
to be updated.

It was lovely code when we got it up and running, nice and clear, with a
good concurrency model. Memory leaks with the actor model meant that the
process had to be restarted several times a week, but it gave us
everything that we wanted.

import ca from '../../assets/blog/clojure-in-action-2nd-edition-cover.png'

<Image alt='image' src={ca} />

In 2010 I got interested in Clojure and Amit Rathore - the author of
[Clojure in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/clojure-in-action-second-edition) -
was running a Clojure workshop about 30 miles from me. I thought Clojure
would be a very fun thing to go and learn. I went to the workshop and I
was blown away that here was a modern LISP running on the JVM. I went
back to work and rebuilt our Scala process in Clojure to see how it
compared. I got the first version running very quickly in a lot less
code. It didn't run as fast, but it didn't have any memory leaks and
kept running 24/7 for months.

**_Andrew: Would you say it had a better concurrency model than the
Scala model?_**

**Sean:** At the time, yes. I was using the actor model where you send
the message and get the actor to do its thing. Clojure has immutable
data structures and a very fluid set of primitives for that. For my
first attempt, I put pmap into some code and was able to get it to run
with so much concurrency that it took down the search engines. We were
able to ramp up another process to send 3.5 million HTML emails a day
from this system, as well as doing all the XML generation and the
database action. The capacity was spectacular and we had to stand up
dedicated instances of search engines to deal with the volume. Scala was
very precise and capable, but it wasn't fun. Clojure is solid
programming and engineering whilst still feeling fun.

## Team Adoption \*\*\*Andrew: How did the rest of the team start using

Clojure?\*\*\*

**Sean:** My team mates were CFML (ColdFusion Markup Language)
developers. I started to introduce Clojure to them and they thought it
was pretty cool and were happy to learn it. We used it initially as a
library language. As we needed to touch the code, we would rewrite it in
Clojure. We had an i18n internationalisation library wrapped around a
MySQL database that was all done in Clojure. We started to switch our
email template generation over, initially using [Enlive](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive), and then [Selmer](https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer) where we had HTML
style templates for emails.

Gradually Clojure began to infiltrate our codebase. Our codebase kept
growing in Clojure and gradually shrinking in CFML. In 2014/15, Clojure
became our primary language for all new work. It's allowed us to
streamline our deployment process and move to a microservice style
architecture. The CFML servers\' footprints are pretty large, even with
the free open source engine that we are using, compared to being able to
roll out Clojure jar files that are 20MB or 30MB, so that's been very
nice.

**_Andrew: How would you say Clojure compares to CFML now that you've
done the switch?_**

**Sean:** With Clojure you get immutable data structures at the core. It
is designed to be a simple, elegant language and everything else is
built on it as libraries, whereas CFML is designed to be a sort of Swiss
army knife of features and you don't get to pick and mix. Accordingly,
what's happened is you don't get the huge open source ecosystem that
Clojure gives you access to. So there isn't the concept of a standard
library. Either functions are built into CFML or they're not. There
hasn't been the drive to create an open source ecosystem around it,
which I think is one of Clojure's huge strengths.

## Tech Community

**_Andrew: What are your thoughts on the Clojure community?_**

**Sean:** The Clojure community is very helpful, very friendly for
beginners, very encouraging and - for such a massive community - it
manages to be generally very polite in tone, and that comes down from
the core team themselves and Rich Hickey, who's made it very clear that [\"he wants respectful discussions\"](https://clojure.org/community/etiquette) - and
trolls really aren't tolerated. I also think the Clojure community has a
much more advanced level of thinking about problems.

**_Andrew: Would you put that down to the nature of functional
programming?_**

**Sean:** I think it is. It's the nature of functional programming and
also to some extent the nature of problems that people solve. People
come to Clojure who have some very large scale, very complicated
problems to solve. They're already dealing with some very advanced
problem spaces. And you get people from all walks of life because it's
not just a web language. People are doing massive data processing,
numerical analysis, cryptocurrency, e-commerce, all sorts of things. Web
development is still one of the number one things that Clojure is used
for, but it's a much broader community and so the level of discourse
tends to be much more advanced.

## Current Tech Stack

**_Andrew: Could you give us a brief breakdown of the technical stack
within World Singles Networks?_**

import re from '../../assets/blog/react-logo.png'

<Image alt='image' src={re} />

**Sean:** For what is now the 3rd generation of the platform, which
we've rolled out to about 40 of our sites so far, that is a JavaScript
[React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
single page app on the front with mostly [Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure) and [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) on the
backend. We have one app that uses [Bidi](https://github.com/juxt/bidi) and Ring. We mostly
talk to MySQL, we use [Percona](https://www.percona.com/) as the variant there, so a
very heavy SQL based application. We have several apps that are very
heavy users of core.async.

import gr from '../../assets/blog/graphql.png'

<Image alt='image' src={gr} />

We have been using [Lacinia](https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia) for
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
in one of the new applications we're rolling out. But it's pretty stock
technology. We don't have message hubs or streams or exotic databases.
We use Redis for some stuff. We are currently using MongoDB and I've
been the maintainer of CongoMongo for quite a while, but we are
consolidating most of that onto MySQL. That's been my current work for
the last few months, looking at where we were using MongoDB and figuring
out how to get it pulled back into MySQL.

**_Andrew: You mentioned React and JavaScript. Do you think you'll move
to ClojureScript for any of that?_**

import cljs from '../../assets/blog/cljs-logo-120b.png'

<Image alt='image' src={cljs} />

**Sean:** We built some internal proof of concept apps with
ClojureScript about 3 Â½ years ago and we did like it, but the tooling
was pretty rough at the time and it was changing very fast so we decided
to stick with JavaScript. It's easier to hire JavaScript developers,
easier to understand and optimize the JavaScript experience on the
frontend and that evolved pretty fast on it's own. Just targeting that
layer on its own has been pretty hard work and we've got some good guys
working on that.

Would we use ClojureScript in the future? There's certainly interest in
it within the company and the tooling has advanced dramatically. The
guys we've got doing React JS work have built things in a functional
style using Immutable JS, Redux and various other things. They like it.
One of them is active in his local Clojure group anyway and the other is
quite fascinated by Clojure everywhere else within the company so it's a
possibility in the future.

## Open Source

**_Andrew: Coming to open source. You've been an active supporter of
open source projects and you've become a maintainer of quite a few
projects over the years. Which open source projects would you say you
are really actively involved in at the moment and are there any that
hold a special place for you?_**

import cl from '../../assets/blog/clojure.png'

<Image alt='image' width={200} src={cl} />

**Sean:** The reason I tend to become a code maintainer on open source
projects is because I want to use them in my day to day work and they
either don't have an active maintainer or I want to get involved enough
to become a code maintainer.

The first Clojure library that I picked up was essentially
[\"clojure.java.jdbc\"](https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc). I picked it
up in the 1.3 days because clojure.contrib.sql wasn't being actively
maintained at the time and in the switch from 1.2 to 1.3, where contrib
was broken up, they needed a new maintainer. I'd been jumping up and
down on the mailing list saying I'd really like to use a modern
equivalent of contrib SQL and was kind of shocked that no one seemed to
be doing SQL database work in Clojure. They were all using the more
exotic databases or just data processing. Finally the core team agreed
to let me become the maintainer, it became clojure.java.jdbc and I've
been maintaining that now for seven years. It was more of a wrapper
around the Java layer and has since evolved into what I would like to
think is a much more Clojure-y style API. It's pretty locked down now
and solid, and I really do enjoy working on it, partly because it's
taught me a lot about different databases. The differences between the
databases is often very frustrating and to run on H2, HSQL, SQLite,
MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and some other databases, some of which I'd
never heard of, all of them with their own peculiarities around whether
or not they deal with auto-generated keys when you're inserting data,
how they return result sets, what you can do with those result sets,
means that the library has to do a lot of low level tweaking and poking
at all of this to make it work and that's always fun.

Since then, I've also got involved with [\"CongoMongo\"](https://github.com/congomongo/congomongo),
[\"clj-time\"](https://github.com/clj-time/clj-time),
[\"core.cache\"](https://github.com/clojure/core.cache) and
[\"core.memoize\"](https://github.com/clojure/core.memoize). The reason
again for getting involved in each of these projects is because we use
them very heavily at work and the maintainers had moved on so someone
needed to step up and take on the issues in the backlog and get
something done with those. I took over [\"tools.cli\"](https://github.com/clojure/tools.cli) for the same
reason. We were using it fairly extensively in a lot of our background
and cron job processes.

import fu from '../../assets/blog/Fumiko-Hanreich-HoneySQL.png'

<Image alt='image' src={fu} />

I've just taken over as the maintainer on HoneySQL because, again, we
use it very heavily. In fact, my former colleague, [\"Fumiko Hanreich,
gave a great talk at Clojure/West in 2015\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alkcjyhesjI&list=PLZdCLR02grLrKAOj8FJ1GGmNM5l7Okz0a)
on the use of that. (Here is [\"Fumiko Hanreich's pre-conference
interview\"](https://lispcast.com/pre-west-interview-fumiko-hanreich/)).
So that's the latest one that I'm now in charge of. I like open source.
I've been doing open source maintenance since the very early 90's. I
worked on some of the early C++ libraries and pretty much every
community I've been in I've tried to contribute to open source. I think
it's a very important way to support and grow a community.

## Hiring

**_Andrew: What are your thoughts on hiring Clojure devs?_**

**Sean:** Hiring good developers is always difficult. We're a fully
remote company. Everyone works from home so our options for hiring have
been much broader, but recently, it has been harder to find people.
There are a lot of people who want to do Clojure and may have good
skills in other tech, but we also need people who can come in on day one
and just ramp up with how the system works without having to also learn
the technology. There is a small group of fairly senior developers now
in Clojure who have been around since the beginning days and they can be
very picky about who they work for and what jobs they do, so it can be
very difficult as a small company to hire those very, very senior
people. So, as a small company, you have to be able to find people with
aptitude and who are going to be able to pick up everything else about
your environment very quickly.

We did find that once we started advertising that we were looking for
Clojure developers, we got a lot of applicants who were smart and had
experience in a lot of tech and wanted to do Clojure. If you're a
company that has the luxury of being able to offer training or mentoring
so that people can come up to speed on Clojure within the company, then
that really does work in your favor. Otherwise, hiring senior engineers
is as hard for Clojure as it is for anything else.

**_Andrew: That seems to be a recurring theme - having smart people that
are really keen to learn Clojure, but also having the ability to allow
them the time to up-skill._**

**Sean:** Yeah, we've been really lucky. The people we've brought on
have been just amazing people to have on the team. When we first cross
trained from CFML, there was a lot of enthusiasm around that. Fumiko has
gone on to work for another Clojure company and really enjoys the tech.
We have Kevin Downey - hiredman as he's known on most things - and he
came up to speed straight away and is building amazing systems for us.
It's a very exciting, fast moving kind of environment and people seem
very keen to come into Clojure and get involved with interesting
problems to solve.
