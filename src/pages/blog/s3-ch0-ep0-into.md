## Write Go Fast — It's Already On Fire

This series explores practical techniques to keep your Go development fast and productive. Fast development is not just about micro-optimizations — its about feedback loops, tooling, and processes that let you iterate with confidence.

- Why speed matters: reduce risk, ship more often.
- Focus areas: tests, tooling, commit hygiene, and small, reversible changes.

Stay tuned for the chapter episodes that follow.
