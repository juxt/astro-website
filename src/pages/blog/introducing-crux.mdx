**_Crux is now XTDB
September 2021 Update: Crux has recently been renamed XTDB. The official home for XTDB is now https://xtdb.com._**

We have just released [Crux](https://juxt.pro/crux/index.html) - an
open-source bitemporal database.

## What is Crux?

Crux is a document store that indexes documents for graph query. The
indexes are bitemporal, meaning that you can query against `valid time`
and `transaction time`, the usefulness of which is covered in our
previous post [\"the value of
bitemporality\"](https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/value-of-bitemporality.html).

## Unbundled

Crux is an _unbundled_ database - to use [Martin
Kleppman's](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/03/04/turning-the-database-inside-out.html)
phrase - shipping as a connected set of pluggable parts. This means that
users can swap out parts and contribute their own, and that Crux itself
follows the [Unix
philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) of each part
doing one thing particularly well.

This pluggability allows Crux to scale with you as your scaling needs
increase. You can start out using Crux with the transaction log being a
local-disk based implementation, and then in future you could switch it
out to Kafka, which offers much higher data throughput and retention
guarantees.

With the open, unbundled architecture, it's intended that Crux be
extended and experimented with. The various _parts_ in Crux are
described by Clojure protocols, meaning that users can get in and
provide their own implementations that would either fully replace or
decorate the existing ones.

## How Crux Works

Crux is schemaless, with transactions being submitted through the Crux
API. The data is then sent to two event-log topics for storage: the
transaction topic and the document topic.

We use two topics because whilst the transaction topic is immutable,
messages in the document topic can be permanently erased, forming the
basis of Crux's ground-up strategy to provide ease of content eviction
for data privacy reasons, to align with compliance regimes such as
[GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/).

Using a separate topic for the content documents also allows for
compaction to remove duplicates, as the message ID is a content hash of
the document. From a Kafka perspective, the transaction topic uses a
single Kafka partition, but it is in our roadmap to shard the document
topic to potentially use multiple partitions.

The event-log that Crux uses is the golden store of data, with Crux
leveraging Kafka's [infinite retention
capability](https://www.confluent.io/blog/okay-store-data-apache-kafka/).

Crux Nodes will then _ingest_ the data from the event-log and index the
transactions and documents locally into a local Key/Value store such as
[RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/) or [LMDB](https://github.com/LMDB/lmdb),
which acts as the foundation for both a local document store and a set
of bitemporal indexes that Crux maintains for graph query. RocksDB and
LMDB use fundamentally different data structures and therefore present a
choice of performance characteristics and trade-offs.

Crux currently supports both a Java and Clojure API. See the
[JavaDocs](https://juxt.pro/crux/docs/javadoc/index.html).

## Transacting and Querying

Crux supports an [Edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) Datalog
format, similar to - though not the same as -
[Datomic's](http://datomic.com). To get a feel of transacting to and
querying against Crux, check out the [query
documentation](https://xtdb.com/reference/queries.html) and/or read Ivan
Fedorov's [\"a bitemporal
tale\"](https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/a-bitemporal-tale.html).

Crux supports four transaction operations:

- `PUT`

- `DELETE`

- `CAS`

- `EVICT`

`PUT` will store a document whereas `DELETE` will delete it from a given
`valid time`, but the data will still be stored in Crux history. Use
`EVICT` to get rid of data permanently, either for all of history, or
for a given `valid time` window. Use `CAS` to compare-and-swap, to
ensure that the data in a document/entity is what you think it is before
adding a new version, or else abort the transaction.

Inside of Crux we use a [Worse Case Optimal
Join](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09930) algorithm, which enables the
query engine to lazily stream out results for an arbitrary complex query
with multiple join conditions and clauses. This, in combination with an
external merge sort used for additional sorting, means that we avoid
manifesting intermediary results in memory.

## Deployment

import cd from '../../assets/blog/crux-deployment.png'

<Image alt='image' src={cd} />

Crux can be deployed as a JAR file within your application, or Crux has
a HTTP server that you can use. You can use Crux in a _standalone_ mode
without Kafka (substituting in a local disk-based event-log), or you can
deploy a cluster of Crux nodes that use Kafka.

## Open

Crux is open source so that you can see the code, commit history, warts
and all. You can see the GitHub issues where design decisions are made,
and you can contribute in this process. You can fork Crux and send PRs
our way. We encourage developers to try out Crux and to expose and
publish patterns of using it, to feedback their ideas and critique.

Crux is a product that JUXT will offer [various
support](https://xtdb.com/support/support.html) models for, including
enterprise support and managed hosting. If you have any questions about
Crux or would like to talk to us about using it, please [email
us](mailto:hello@xtdb.com) or visit our
[Zulip](https://juxt-oss.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/194466-xtdb).

Have a [play with XTDB](https://docs.xtdb.com/guides/quickstart/) - add
the JAR to your project and scale up from there. Crux is Alpha. Please
raise any issues on our [GitHub](https://github.com/juxt/crux).
