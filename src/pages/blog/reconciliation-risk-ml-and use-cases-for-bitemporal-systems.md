On October 1st, I gave a talk at [OSFF NYC](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-finance-forum-new-york/) (Open Source for Finance Forum), which condensed over 5 years of R&D effort alongside countless conversations with people across many roles and geographies about what they need from their database systems. The consensus is that almost everybody cares about retaining an auditable history of their data, but nobody has figured out the best way of ensuring it happens correctly.

The organisations involved with FINOS are well placed to judge the merits of XTDB's design and applicability for the wider marketplace of regulated data & compliance reporting, and if the reaction from the audience on the day (not to mention the turnout!) was anything to go by then XTDB is definitely on the right tracks.

Watch my talk below â€” you can find my slides [here](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/osffny2024/f1/juxt-bitemporal-systems-osff24-v1.pdf) (and check out [XTDB.com](https://xtdb.com/) if you want to learn more).
