## Concurrency Without Chaos

Concurrency unlocks scalability, but it can introduce subtle bugs and resource leaks if not structured clearly.

- How to structure goroutines cleanly: encapsulate lifecycle, prefer worker pools for bounded concurrency, and use well-defined ownership of cancellation.
- sync.WaitGroup vs channels vs contexts: use WaitGroup for simple join semantics, channels for event-driven pipelines, and contexts for cancellation and deadlines.
- Don’t leak memory or spawn unbounded goroutines: always tie goroutines to cancellation contexts and enforce limits on concurrency.
- How to reason about and observe concurrency: instrument goroutine counts, thread/OS metrics, and use pprof goroutine profiles and tracing to find stuck or blocked goroutines.

Practical tips:

- Give each goroutine a single responsibility and an explicit shutdown path.
- Prefer contexts for cancelation signals across call stacks.
- Use buffered channels or worker pools to smooth bursts and bound resource usage.
- Add observability: expose goroutine metrics and use sampling traces to diagnose contention.

Well-structured concurrency is maintainable and observable — design for clear ownership, bounded resources, and graceful shutdown.
