# A distributed, diverse company

[Puppet](https://puppet.com/company) make open-source software
configuration and infrastructure automation software. They are a 475
person strong company with people spread all over the world including
the US, Canada, the Czech Republic, Sweden, the UK and Australia.
Diversity is a key element of Puppet Lab's success, bringing together
developers to form a community based on different backgrounds, ethnicity
and gender.

Originally Puppet was a Ruby development house. About 4-5 years they
transitioned their remote service layer to Clojure, creating some
high-profile and popular open-source products as a result, including
[Trapperkeeper](https://github.com/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper) and more
recently [Comidi](https://github.com/puppetlabs/comidi).

I had a chat with Tech leads Scott Walker and Pieter Loubser about the
Clojure journey at Puppet. Scott works out of the Belfast, UK office and
Pieter works remotely from London.

# The history of Clojure at Puppet

_Jon Pither:_ How did Clojure get started at Puppet?

_Scott Walker:_ About four years ago our CTO Deepak Giridharagopal
introduced it. We wanted to transition to the JVM, and from there
Clojure seemed like a better way of doing things rather than going with
Java.

_Pieter Loubser:_ [Puppet DB](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb)
was our first big Clojure project, which is over 4 years old now.

_Scott Walker:_ We then also migrated our Ruby based
[Puppet-Master](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/services_master_rack.html)
tool to the JVM, the new incarnation being called [Puppet
Server](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetserver). Puppet-Server makes
extensive use of Clojure, using our familiar in-house stack based on
Trapperkeeper.

When we ported our Ruby app to the JVM we saw massive performance
benefits. We got true concurrency; horizontal scaling on a single node
using JVM threads.

And of course once it was on the JVM, we were no longer tied to Ruby and
could use Clojure.

# Open Source

_Jon Pither:_ Let's jump in to what open source Clojure offerings Puppet
has built. In particular, please tell me about
[Trapperkeeper](https://github.com/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper).

_Scott Walker:_ Trapperkeeper provides building blocks for Clojure
applications - a service lifecycle framework. It provides configuration
out of the box, everything a service needs such as monitoring and
metrics gathering. It saves developers from having to write their own
time-consuming boilerplate.

There are components for Jetty, WebSockets, a scheduler and more.
Trapperkeeper takes Java APIs such as the [Apache Http Asynchronous
Client](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-asyncclient-dev/) and makes
them accessible.

_Pieter Loubser_: It's like a filo-fax - a binder for Clojure production
ready code. The idea of a binder is where [the name came
from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapper_Keeper).

_Scott Walker:_ Trapperkeeper has lots of users now and there's a
community built around it, so it continues to evolve.

_Jon Pither:_ Any other prominent open-source Clojure libraries?

_Scott Walker:_ There is [Comidi](https://github.com/puppetlabs/comidi)
allowing you to use a
[Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure) styled syntax to
integrate with the [Bidi](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure)
routing library. It marries the strengths of both libraries - the
expressive syntax-sugar of Compojure with the bidirectional simple
data-structure approach of Bidi.

_Pieter Loubser:_ We also have
[clj-kitchensink](https://github.com/puppetlabs/clj-kitchensink) which
is a library full of our commonly used utilities.

# Clojure

_Jon Pither:_ Let's dig into Clojure at Puppet, what's it been like
adopting Clojure?

_Scott Walker:_ I come from a computer science background. I've done a
lot of Java, but I found that the kind of Java code I was writing was
evolving to become more functional - i.e. using less mutable state where
possible. Then Clojure came along and it was a perfect fit for me. With
Clojure you naturally adhere to good design principles, it leads you to
a different and better way of thinking.

It's a good experience to learn a new language every once in a while and
go through that process of coding up _Hello World_. When you freshen up
your skill-set and gain new experiences it helps you to write better
code overall.

_Pieter Loubser_: For me the Java interop of Clojure is a big deal. When
I picked up Clojure I needed to spike something big, and being able to
use existing Java libraries and tools helped with this.

_Scott Walker:_ At Puppet we believe that with Clojure we can write
better code in less time that is more expressive. Clojure has worked
well from the get-go and people enjoy using it.

# Hiring

_Jon Pither:_ How have you found the hiring process?

_Scott Walker:_ Clojure was one of the reasons I was attracted to
Puppet. I think it was a real statement of intent by Puppet to adopt
Clojure in the way they that have - especially around four years ago
when it was still considered _new_. I was impressed and it summed the
company up as being technically astute and forward looking.

_Jon Pither:_ What about searching for Clojure developers?

_Scott Walker:_ We don't hire specifically for Clojure developers,
rather we look for great engineers. Most of the people we hire are
typically a high calibre and excited about learning Clojure.

# Training

_Jon Pither:_ What has the up-skill process being like for getting other
devs into Clojure?

_Scott Walker:_ We have a strong emphasis on self learning, where
developers take responsibility as engineers to up-skill themselves. We
make sure developers have the resources they need, including being able
to talk the most experienced people in one particular area. Our senior
developers spend lots of time coaching and advising others.

We use GitHub here and we are very tight on the code-base, ensuring that
all commits have had more than a single pair of eyes on them.

Also Puppet has been involved at all the major Clojure conferences.
Going to conferences is fantastic for sparking creativity and creating
seeds of enthusiasm.

# State of Clojure

_Jon Pither:_ What do you feel the state of Clojure is now?

_Pieter Loubser_: Clojure was originally a bit hipster with people
questioning why they should go off and learn a Lisp. This seems to have
been reversed now with people being more open minded and this is
healthy.

_Jon Pither:_ How is Clojure doing in Belfast in particular?

_Scott Walker:_ There's a functional meetup called [Functional
Kats](http://www.meetup.com/Functional-Kats-Belfast/). They have these
in Dublin and Belfast, with Clojure often being one of the languages
people want to play with.

I'd say there is a core of people using Clojure in Belfast and it's
growing slowly. I think on the whole there's a generational shift
happening. Middle management is seeing what the newer generation of
programmers want to use and is adapting. Opinion is shifting.

_Jon Pither:_ Any recently developments in the Clojuresphere that excite
you?

_Pieter Loubser_: [Spec](http://clojure.org/about/spec) looks cool, I'm
sure everyone at the moment would answer this question with Spec.

_Scott Walker:_ It's liberating to choose when to use tools like Spec,
as oppose to with static types where you are forced down a certain road.

# Technologies

_Jon Pither:_ Any technologies you'd like to give a shout out to?

_Pieter Loubser_: Trapperkeeper! ([See a Clojure/West video Intro to
Trapperkeeper video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IniU7pF5-vs))

_Scott Walker:_ I'd also say have a look at
[PuppetDB](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb) as an example of a
fairly long lived and mature Clojure project. There should be lots of
idiomatic, well-composed Clojure code in there!
