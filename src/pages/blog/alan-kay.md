This summer we were due to hold our XT20 conference, which was going to
focus on how we could bring some of the approaches of the past to tackle
the challenges of the present and the future. Unfortunately, one of
these future challenges arrived, and we had to make the difficult
decision to cancel the event.

Alan Kay was one of the leading researchers at the legendary labs of
ARPA and Xerox PARC in the 1960s and 1970s. We wanted to understand from
Alan how Xerox PARC came to be, and how could possibly reproduce what
happened there, to make similar leaps for our industry in the future.

When we held our XT16 conference, we made short videos with all of our
speakers to introduce their talks, and we wanted to continue this
tradition with XT20. So prior to the cancellation, we recorded a short
piece with Alan to introduce the content of his talk.

Alan stresses that we're only just at the start of our industry and that
we've a long way to go. As he puts it, many of great ideas from the
1960s and 1970s are still landing, before we consider the new
ground-breaking ideas that are yet to be found. To find those ideas, we
need to seek out the brightest among us, and then we have to figure out
how to fund and manage them properly.

## The extended cut!

We continued the discussion, and here is the _long-form_ of Alan's
thoughts on invention, climate change, Covid-19, education and more.
