Welcome to **Write Go Fast** — a pragmatic guide to Go programming when time is your scarcest resource.

## The Reality Check

With enough time, anyone can write beautiful, idiomatic Go code. But what happens when you're building a quick proof-of-concept? Racing toward a fast-approaching deadline? Prototyping under pressure?

That's when you need to write **good enough** code that adapts well later. Code that gets the job done without painting you into architectural corners. Code that's pragmatic first, perfect second.

## What This Series Covers

This isn't another "learn Go from scratch" tutorial. This is about **getting productive fast** while building maintainable foundations. We start with the essential knowledge that prevents costly rewrites later.

### **Foundations** (Parts 1–5)

The non-negotiable basics when coming from other languages:

- **Part 1: Finding the Familiar** — Leverage what you already know from statically typed languages
- **Part 2: Unlearning the Familiar** — Critical differences that will catch you out (error handling, interfaces, goroutines)
- **Part 3: Language Traps** — Gotchas like defer in loops, goroutine leaks, nil interface comparisons
- **Part 4: Data Structures** — Go's built-in types and when to reach for higher-level containers
- **Part 5: Day-One Habits** — How to start fast without falling into over-idiomatic rabbit holes

### **Coming Next: Patterns That Actually Help**

Real-world patterns that solve recurring problems:
- Builder pattern for baseplate setup, error creation, HTTP client config
- Adapter pattern to abstract database layers and keep logic decoupled  
- Singleton (injected) for config/logger/metrics — created once, passed everywhere

### **And Beyond: The Complete Toolkit**

From dependency injection strategies to performance troubleshooting, fast testing to concurrency without chaos — everything you need to **write Go fast** and **ship with confidence**.

## Who This Is For

You're an experienced developer who needs to:

- Get productive in Go quickly for a new project or role
- Build proof-of-concepts that can evolve into production systems
- Write maintainable code under tight deadlines
- Avoid common pitfalls that slow teams down

If you value **pragmatic over perfect** and **shipping over studying**, this series is for you.

## Let's Start Building

Ready to write Go that ships? Start with [Part 1: Finding the Familiar](./part-1-finding-the-familiar) and learn to leverage what you already know.

Time to build something that works — and works well.
