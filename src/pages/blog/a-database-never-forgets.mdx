We recently attended a virtual meetup on the subject of temporality in
databases, titled _\"What if your databases never forgot\"_, presented
by Rahul Dé - aka [`@lispyclouds`](https://twitter.com/lispyclouds) - a
Senior Infrastructure Consultant with ThoughtWorks.

The meetup was part of the ongoing \"TW presents\" series organized by
ThoughtWorks Berlin. See the [video replay](https://thoughtworks.zoom.us/rec/play/gtlK2A-0W29t6gp5w_FAjynhEdMutgooHTAfPZ7uECWkoUOSTuT3EKmNOi3EeWtzC57F7Rn4ZXBCDJ7J.bI8wEe1Nye42sZID?continueMode=true)
and
[slides](https://speakerdeck.com/lispyclouds/what-if-your-databases-never-forgot).

Rahul did a great job outlining why keeping a first-class history of the
data in your database is valuable from both operational and business
perspectives. He discussed how the ability to query historical versions
of a database can save application developers from having to extend
their own data model and queries to explicitly deal with time. He also
talked about temporal databases being an extension of the functional
programming model, whereby our queries are essentially functions working
against a log of accrued immutable facts.

Crux was featured during the talk alongside other databases with
first-class temporal features (e.g.
[Datahike](https://github.com/replikativ/datahike)), and we were pleased
to participate in a subsequent Q&A, which examined performance, data
eviction, data migration, SQL 2011, schema(less) design and more. We
hope you enjoy it!
