In this episode, JUXT’s CTO Malcolm Sparks, Head of Delivery Joe Littlejohn, and I are joined by guest Software Engineer Jake Howard to engage in a thoughtful discussion on the enduring static vs dynamic typing debate. While static typing has long been a staple in programming, the conversation leans toward the growing appeal of dynamic typing in modern software practices.

We explore how dynamic typing allows for quicker iteration, greater flexibility, and better adaptation to shifting project demands. We also take time to weigh the structure and reliability that static typing provides, making for a balanced look at both approaches.
