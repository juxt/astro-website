[OnTheMarket.com](https://www.onthemarket.com) is a major new online
property portal advertising hundreds of thousands of new properties to
the general public. The portal was launched with a high profile [TV
campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loSbAMKr_h0) in January 2015
and is now going from strength to strength.

In early 2014 JUXT was approached to lead the development of the website
and supporting systems.

In just ten months the development team built and released:

- A world class public facing website.

- A robust and performant data processing pipeline to continually
  process 5000+ branch feeds via hundreds of different providers.

- A separate portal for estate agents to manage their property
  portfolio.

- An administrative system used by the front-line support team to
  quickly diagnose and help solve agent issues.

In 2015 every part of the system was released on time and on budget.
