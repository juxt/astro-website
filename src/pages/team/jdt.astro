          SQL is almost 50 years old and the cost of storage has decreased dramatically over its lifetime.
In this talk, Jeremy Taylor explains why SQL’s UPDATE statement is problematic in our modern context and how developers are forced to work around it. He also examines ‘bitemporality’ — a standardised model for working with versioned historical data that mitigates the need for such workarounds.
