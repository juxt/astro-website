# JUXT AI Radar

**An opinionated guide to the AI landscape from JUXT, a Grid Dynamics company**

Welcome to the first edition of the JUXT AI Radar, where we map the landscape of AI tools, technologies, frameworks, and practices based on our collective expertise and client experiences. Our committee of technology experts has carefully evaluated each entry based on real-world applications, industry trends, and practical utility. This radar represents our current viewpoint and will evolve as the rapidly changing AI ecosystem matures.

## Radar Overview

Our radar is organized into four main categories, each containing technologies evaluated across four adoption levels:

- **Adopt**: Technologies we recommend using now
- **Trial**: Worth exploring for new projects
- **Assess**: Keep under observation
- **Hold**: Not recommended for new projects

## Categories

### [Techniques](/ai-radar/techniques/)

AI methodologies, approaches, and practices that shape how we build intelligent systems.
