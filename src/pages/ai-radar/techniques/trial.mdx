## Cross-encoder Reranking

Cross-encoder reranking represents an advanced approach to information retrieval that can significantly improve search result quality. By re-evaluating candidate documents with more sophisticated models, cross-encoders can capture complex semantic relationships that traditional retrieval methods miss. The technique shows particular promise for applications requiring high-precision search results.

## Chain of Thought (CoT)

Chain of Thought prompting has emerged as a powerful technique for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models. By encouraging models to show their work and think step-by-step, CoT can dramatically improve performance on complex reasoning tasks. The technique is particularly valuable for mathematical problems, logical reasoning, and multi-step problem solving.

## Model Distillation & Synthetic Data

Model distillation combined with synthetic data generation offers a promising approach to creating smaller, more efficient models without sacrificing performance. This technique can help reduce computational requirements while maintaining model quality, making AI applications more accessible and cost-effective. The approach is particularly valuable for edge computing and resource-constrained environments.

## UMAP

Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) has emerged as a powerful technique for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. Compared to traditional methods like t-SNE, UMAP offers better preservation of both local and global structure while being significantly faster. The technique is particularly valuable for exploring high-dimensional data and understanding model behavior.
