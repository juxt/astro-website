AI techniques encompass the methodologies, approaches, and practices that form the foundation of intelligent systems. From classical machine learning to cutting-edge large language model techniques, these approaches shape how we build, train, and deploy AI solutions.

## Adoption Levels

Our techniques are evaluated across four adoption levels based on maturity, community adoption, and practical utility:

### [Adopt](/ai-radar/techniques/adopt/)

Techniques that have proven their value in production environments and are recommended for immediate use.

**Featured techniques**: Classical ML, RAG, LLM-as-a-Judge, BERT variants, Few-shot prompting

### [Trial](/ai-radar/techniques/trial/)

Promising techniques worth exploring for new projects, with growing community support.

**Featured techniques**: Cross-encoder reranking, Chain of Thought (CoT), Model Distillation & Synthetic data, UMAP

### [Assess](/ai-radar/techniques/assess/)

Emerging techniques that show potential but require careful evaluation before adoption.

**Featured techniques**: Structured RAG, Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE), Fine-tuning with LoRA, Agentic tool use

### [Hold](/ai-radar/techniques/hold/)

Techniques that are either outdated, have better alternatives, or lack sufficient evidence for adoption.

**Featured techniques**: Word2Vec & GloVe, t-SNE, Zero-shot prompting, AI Pull Request Review

## Key Considerations

When evaluating AI techniques, we consider:

- **Performance characteristics**: Accuracy, speed, and resource requirements
- **Scalability**: How well the technique works at scale
- **Interpretability**: Ability to understand and explain results
- **Integration complexity**: Ease of implementation in existing systems
- **Community support**: Documentation, tutorials, and active development

## Getting Started

Choose your adoption level based on your project requirements and risk tolerance. Start with **Adopt** techniques for proven solutions, or explore **Trial** techniques for innovative approaches to new challenges.
