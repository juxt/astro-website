title: 'Languages & Frameworks: Hold'
---

These languages and frameworks are not recommended for new projects due to declining relevance, better alternatives, or limited long-term viability. While some may still have niche applications, they generally represent technologies that have been superseded by more effective solutions.

<div data-radar data-meta='{"label":"TensorFlow"}' />
## TensorFlow

While TensorFlow was once the dominant deep learning framework, it has been largely superseded by PyTorch in most domains. TensorFlow's complexity, limited debugging capabilities, and slower development pace have made it less attractive for new projects. PyTorch offers better developer experience and more active community support.

<div data-radar data-meta='{"label":"Keras"}' />
## Keras

Keras has been integrated into TensorFlow and has lost much of its independent value. While it still provides a high-level API, the benefits of using Keras standalone have diminished. Modern PyTorch workflows and other high-level frameworks offer better alternatives for rapid prototyping and development.

<div data-radar data-meta='{"label":"R"}' />
## R

R's role in AI and machine learning has diminished significantly with the rise of Python and its rich ecosystem. While R still has strengths in statistical analysis, its limited deep learning capabilities and smaller community make it less suitable for modern AI development. Python offers better tools and broader ecosystem support.

<div data-radar data-meta='{"label":"OpenCL"}' />
## OpenCL

OpenCL has been largely superseded by more modern GPU computing frameworks like CUDA and specialized AI frameworks. While OpenCL offers cross-platform compatibility, its complexity and limited AI-specific optimizations make it less suitable for modern AI development. More specialized frameworks provide better performance and easier development.
