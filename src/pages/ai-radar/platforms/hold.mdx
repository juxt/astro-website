These platforms are not recommended for adoption due to limited value, better alternatives, or significant vendor lock-in risks. While some may offer specific capabilities, they generally represent approaches that don't provide sufficient value to justify the associated risks and limitations.

## Building against Vendor-specific APIs

Building AI applications that are tightly coupled to vendor-specific APIs creates significant vendor lock-in and limits flexibility. While these APIs may offer convenience in the short term, they create long-term dependencies that can be costly and difficult to overcome. Teams should prefer provider-agnostic approaches that maintain flexibility and reduce vendor lock-in risks.
