AI application bootstrappers promise to accelerate the development of AI applications by providing pre-built templates and scaffolding. While the concept is appealing, the quality and flexibility of these tools vary significantly. Teams should carefully evaluate whether the benefits of rapid prototyping justify the potential limitations and maintenance overhead of generated code.
