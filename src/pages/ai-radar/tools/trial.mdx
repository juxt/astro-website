# Trial

These tools show promising potential with growing adoption and active development. While they may not yet have the same maturity as Adopt tools, they offer innovative approaches and capabilities that make them worth exploring for forward-thinking teams.

## Agentic Computer Use

We're seeing AI agents being developed for increasingly complex and varied environments, such as web agents that can browse and interact with online content like OpenAI's Operator to systems that interact with a user's whole operating system such as Claude Computer Use. Each agent is designed with specific capabilities and constraints suited to its operational environment: a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) agent might be optimised for searching and synthesising internal documentation, while a development environment agent needs deep understanding of codebases and development workflows.

A particularly interesting trend is the emergence of agents that operate across entire computing environments such as Devin, with the ability to execute terminal commands, manipulate files, and interact with development tools. This expanded scope brings both opportunities and challenges: while these agents can potentially automate complex workflows, they require careful consideration around access controls, security boundaries, and failure recovery mechanisms.

We've placed AI Agents in the Trial ring. While we're seeing promising early applications, particularly in constrained environments like RAG systems, the technology is still evolving rapidly and best practices around security, reliability, and control mechanisms are still emerging. The potential for both value and risk is significant, warranting close attention but careful consideration before widespread adoption.

We're seeing a clear pattern of successful implementations when agents are given well-defined boundaries and carefully curated tool access. Organisations are reporting meaningful productivity gains, particularly in areas like document processing, customer service, and development workflows. The ability to chain together multiple operations while maintaining context is proving valuable in many scenarios.

However, we're also observing significant challenges around reliability, security, and control. Agents can sometimes get stuck in loops, make incorrect tool selections, or fail to properly handle edge cases. There are also important questions around audit trails, permissions management, and failure recovery that need to be addressed. Until these concerns are more fully resolved, we recommend careful assessment and controlled trials rather than widespread adoption.
