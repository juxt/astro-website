# Hold

These tools are not recommended for new projects due to declining relevance, better alternatives, or limited long-term viability. While some may still have niche applications, they generally represent technologies that have been superseded by more effective solutions.

## Conversational data analysis

We've placed conversational data analysis tools in the Hold ring as this emerging category shows promise but requires careful evaluation at present. These tools aim to enable data analysis through natural language interactions rather than writing code directly.

Tools such as [pandas-ai](https://github.com/sinaptik-ai/pandas-ai), [tablegpt](https://github.com/tablegpt/tablegpt-agent), [promptql](https://promptql.hasura.io/), [Julius](https://julius.ai/), and [Gathr's data engineering](https://www.gathr.ai/data-engineering/) allow analysts to query datasets using plain English, generating code behind the scenes. While this could potentially democratise data analysis and data engineering, we have concerns about the reliability and predictability of the generated code. The AI can sometimes misinterpret requests or misrepresent results. For instance, Uber has documented its internal [QueryGPT tool](https://www.uber.com/en-GB/blog/query-gpt/), highlighting the significant number of example queries and guardrails required to achieve acceptable reliability.

We're also monitoring how these tools handle data privacy, given they often require sending queries to external AI services. For teams considering these tools, we recommend starting with non-sensitive datasets and asking analytics questions to which you already know the answers.
