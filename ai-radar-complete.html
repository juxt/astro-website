<h2 id="intro"><a href="#intro" class="heading-link">Intro</a></h2>
<p>Welcome to the first edition of the JUXT AI Radar, where we map the landscape of AI tools, technologies, frameworks, and practices based on our collective expertise and client experiences. Our committee of technology experts has carefully evaluated each entry based on real-world applications, industry trends, and practical utility. This radar represents our current viewpoint and will evolve as the rapidly changing AI ecosystem matures.</p>
<h2 id="radar-overview"><a href="#radar-overview" class="heading-link">Radar Overview</a></h2>
<p>Our radar is organized into four main categories, each containing technologies evaluated across four adoption levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adopt</strong>: Technologies we recommend using now</li>
<li><strong>Trial</strong>: Worth exploring for new projects</li>
<li><strong>Assess</strong>: Keep under observation</li>
<li><strong>Hold</strong>: Not recommended for new projects</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="categories"><a href="#categories" class="heading-link">Categories</a></h2>

<section class="article-section adopt-section">
<h3 class="sub-heading" id="tools-adopt">adopt</h3>

<p>These tools represent essential additions to AI development workflows that significantly improve productivity, code quality, and development experience. They have proven their value in production environments and are recommended for immediate adoption by AI development teams.</p>
<h2 id="tools-software-engineering-copilots"><a href="#tools-software-engineering-copilots" class="heading-link">Software Engineering Copilots</a></h2>
<p>AI-powered coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and similar tools have become essential for modern software development. These tools significantly improve developer productivity by providing intelligent code suggestions, documentation generation, and automated testing. Their integration with existing development workflows makes them valuable for teams of all sizes.</p>
<h2 id="tools-provider-agnostic-llm-facades"><a href="#tools-provider-agnostic-llm-facades" class="heading-link">Provider-agnostic LLM Facades</a></h2>
<p>Provider-agnostic abstractions for large language models have become essential for building robust AI applications. These tools allow developers to switch between different LLM providers without changing application code, providing flexibility and reducing vendor lock-in. The ability to optimize costs and performance across different providers makes these tools valuable for production applications.</p>
<h2 id="tools-notebooks"><a href="#tools-notebooks" class="heading-link">Notebooks</a></h2>
<p>Jupyter notebooks and similar interactive development environments remain essential for AI development, particularly for data exploration, model experimentation, and documentation. Modern notebook environments with enhanced collaboration features, version control integration, and production deployment capabilities make them valuable for both research and production workflows.</p>

<section class="article-section trial-section">
<h3 class="sub-heading" id="tools-trial">trial</h3>

<p>These tools offer innovative approaches to AI development that show promise for enhancing productivity and capabilities. While they may not yet have the same maturity as Adopt tools, they represent emerging technologies worth exploring for teams looking to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
<h2 id="tools-agentic-computer-use"><a href="#tools-agentic-computer-use" class="heading-link">Agentic Computer Use</a></h2>
<p>Agentic approaches to computer interaction, where AI agents can autonomously perform tasks on behalf of users, represent an exciting frontier in AI development. These tools show promise for automating complex workflows and reducing manual intervention in development processes. While still emerging, their potential for productivity gains makes them worth exploring for forward-thinking teams.</p>

<section class="article-section assess-section">
<h3 class="sub-heading" id="tools-assess">assess</h3>

<p>These tools represent emerging technologies that show interesting potential but require careful evaluation before integration into development workflows. They may offer innovative capabilities but come with uncertainties about long-term viability, implementation complexity, or practical value.</p>
<h2 id="tools-ai-application-bootstrappers"><a href="#tools-ai-application-bootstrappers" class="heading-link">AI Application Bootstrappers</a></h2>
<p>AI application bootstrappers promise to accelerate the development of AI applications by providing pre-built templates and scaffolding. While the concept is appealing, the quality and flexibility of these tools vary significantly. Teams should carefully evaluate whether the benefits of rapid prototyping justify the potential limitations and maintenance overhead of generated code.</p>

<section class="article-section hold-section">
<h3 class="sub-heading" id="tools-hold">hold</h3>

<p>These tools are not recommended for adoption due to limited utility, better alternatives, or insufficient evidence of effectiveness. While some may have niche applications, they generally represent approaches that donâ€™t provide sufficient value to justify integration into development workflows.</p>
<h2 id="tools-conversational-data-analysis"><a href="#tools-conversational-data-analysis" class="heading-link">Conversational Data Analysis</a></h2>
<p>Conversational interfaces for data analysis have shown limited effectiveness in practice. While the concept of natural language interaction with data is appealing, these tools often struggle with complex queries and provide less efficient workflows than traditional data analysis tools. The trade-off between ease of use and analytical power makes them unsuitable for most professional data analysis needs.</p>
